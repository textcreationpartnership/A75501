            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The <hi>Epiſtle Dedicatory.</hi> TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>TO all that deſire to worſhip God, in Spirit and Truth, eſpeciall to Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, that have any Conſcientious Care to pleaſe God in it: to whom theſe Pages come.</p>
            <p>Men, Fathers, and Brethren; Reverend and Beloved: hear ye my Apology, <hi>Acts 22.1.</hi> &amp;c. not for my ſelf, nor unto you, ſo much as for you in your preſent Diſſent, Diſtance (and Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in Worſhip) from the now legal Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment.</p>
            <p>'Tis a happy thing (ſays Biſhop <hi>Hall,</hi> in his Contemplation on K. <hi>Joſias's</hi> tenderneſs, <hi>p. 1306</hi>) to be as a gentle Reed to God's Judgments, rather than a ſtiff Oak; for while that ſtands, this is tore up by the Roots.</p>
            <p>This tenderneſs beſt adorns Royal Breaſts; yet befits all that reverence Law, or dread Wrath Divine: the Caſe was ſad with <hi>Iſrael</hi> now; yet bleſſed in the tenderneſs of the Kings Heart, <hi>2 King. 22.19.</hi> under impending Woes. <hi>Rak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebabeka—Cor emolitum eſt.</hi> He melted to Tears. <hi>Inſtar cerae:</hi> as Wax ſoftens at the Sun.</p>
            <p>Tenderneſs of heart is a Royal Grace; in two things it is ſeen. <hi>1.</hi> In avoiding what in the leaſt provokes Jealouſie.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:151110:3"/>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2.</hi> In trembling both at Wrath inflicted, and impending; ſo <hi>Joſiah</hi> did. Royal Examples (not in evil, but good) are ſet for Imitation of all: That Judgments impend on us for old Guilt, I need not ſay to you, that feel the drops of the ſtorm already falling: all I note here, is, Did I not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, a tender Conſcience lay at the Root of your Nonconformity, I would not have run this adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to plead your Cauſe in this perillous juncture.</p>
            <p>The Light of Goſpel, Truth, and Purity of, Gods Worſhip are two Eſſentials of right <hi>Chriſtianity:</hi> without the firſt, the Profeſſion is Hereſy; and without the ſecond, the Worſhip is but Idolatry, though the Agent may be very devout in it: both put together, inferr a godly Life.</p>
            <p>About right Worſhip (after Doctrines are clear'd) many are the Altercations that have happened, ever ſince the <hi>Roman</hi> Apoſtacy obtain'd, not only betwixt <hi>Papiſts</hi> and us; but among <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants</hi> themſelves: if about the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> ſo many Opinious have been ventilated, (and that is but one part of Goſpel Worſhip,) how many may be in all the Parts and Duties of it, ſuppoſed? and that both long and eager in both litigants. And who can ſufficiently condole the bad effects that have ſlowed from Gally Pens and Stomacks; eſpecially, where Formality in the one Party, and Sincerity in the other, have been Competitors.</p>
            <p>But in two <hi>Points</hi> (about Worſhip) Men's Concertings (a late) have moſt been converſant: <hi>1.</hi> About the <hi>Purity</hi> of the thing. <hi>2.</hi> The Liberty of the Door: Againſt the firſt is <hi>Superſtition;</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:151110:3"/>that polutes it, ſo alters its nature: and <hi>Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution</hi> hinders the latter.</p>
            <p>Hence our late Debates and Animoſities here, have ſprung in <hi>Brittain,</hi> and other parts adjacent, to the great decay of the power of Godlineſs, and ſetting up that ſtump of a Formal Dagon, (half Man, half Fiſh) a mungril Profeſſion, above it. And be the Profeſſion never ſo refined, in point of Doctrine, if it only float in the Head, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend not to the Heart with power, to the Life in <hi>Practice,</hi> it makes the <hi>Profeſſor</hi> but a meer Formaliſt, an <hi>Eraſtian,</hi> or Perſecutor, (as <hi>Iſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el</hi>) of him that is born after the Spirit; and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the more devout, the more rigid: ſo opens a back door for <hi>Hypocriſy, Atheiſm,</hi> and <hi>Apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy;</hi> as many that in Q. <hi>Mary's</hi> days were <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts,</hi> in Q. <hi>Eliz.</hi> were advanc't to places, and ſo became <hi>Proteſtant Perſecutors,</hi> and that of ſome unto death; as were eaſie to inſtance.</p>
            <p>This bitter water of Jealouſie, mixt with the duſt of the Sanctuary, (not of its Eſſence) has cauſed the Power to rot, and Belly to ſwell, of ſome <hi>Sham-Proteſtants</hi> againſt their Brethren, for the ſake of ſome <hi>Romiſh</hi> Rites, (not of the <hi>eſſe</hi> to Religion, at all) ſo that they do hazard a Reconciliation, and return to <hi>Rome,</hi> (in defence of her Raggs) rather than to build on, upon the fair bottom of Reformation, begun. And hence is the occaſion of this Diſcourſe. To which the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor</hi> had theſe Inducements.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:151110:5"/>though in their Grave Cloaths they ſeem a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour to their beſt Friends: yet the Earth quake is an adjunct and ſign of their Reſurrection: that will affright their worſt Enemies.</p>
            <p>For the Book it ſelf, I call it an <hi>Apology</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated for all <hi>Proteſtants</hi> in general, that do pretend to be right Worſhippers in Spirit and Truth: but if any ſlight it, (or need not to it) this fits your <hi>Meridian</hi> beſt, (till others come to feel that heat you do) wherein the Suns Elevati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is to that degree, that you are ſcorcht, and look't on as black: for you is this <hi>Apology</hi> made.</p>
            <p>I direct it not to the High and Great; that would be deemed Preſumption in one ſo low: nor to the Regent Imperial Clergy; their Auto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cratorical Majeſties would (at beſt) but lay it by, as <hi>Caeſar,</hi> that Note that did ſo much concern his Life, and not read it.</p>
            <p>Nor do I ſend it abroad, being not able, had I Language and Opportunity to bear that Charge; nor will my Acquaintance reach. For you it is deſigned, to you dedicated: if you are as fearful of your <hi>Purſe,</hi> as ſome a late of their <hi>Pulpits,</hi> the Author can but looſe his Cost and Pains: but it is pity you ſhould ſlight your Friends <hi>Apology,</hi> far more, if in the Cauſe of God: Temptations that hence flow on poor Brethren, are ill conſidered: as ſome are judged too daring and ventrous, others dare not do what is Duty to God, and their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, but deſert them in the common Cauſe of God, as Herds do by the Hunted. <hi>In pace Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, in prelio Cervi.</hi> Lord ſend us nobler Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:151110:6"/>
            <p>If the Scope be askt, the two Verſes at the front do well import it, <hi>viz.</hi> That God ſtill defends his Worſhip (in all <hi>Ages</hi>) in a way of ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Providence, or (that failing) by ſome efforts of extraordinary power: what <hi>Proofs</hi> I give, and <hi>Inſtances</hi> of it, I leave with the whole aim and manner of pleading, to the Judicious.</p>
            <p>If my reaſon be weak, and reading ſhort, or parts too ſhallow for the Deſign, I own all: only the End is good, and worthy the beſt of Perſons, and Parts to defend: I only glory in the Breaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate, or Girdle of <hi>Sincerity:</hi> all dare plead the Cauſe of beautiful Truths, few plead for biting Truths. All are ſettled in Doctrines (hundreds of years old) few there be that are eſtabliſht in preſent Truths, as in <hi>2 Pet. 1.12.</hi> Saints ſcatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ought to be.</p>
            <p>If any deem the <hi>Plea</hi> too tart, <hi>Paſſages</hi> too near and cloſe, I ſay, none are named ſave thoſe whoſe Caſe requires, and that not injuriouſly, or irreverently: men that make themſelves notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous by their astions now, muſt not fret that their Names are left in record, as infamous hereafter. <hi>Salt</hi> was required in God's old Law, which is penetrant and ſharp, yet ſavoury: when Honey is forbid, Sweets are leſs profitable, than Bitters.</p>
            <p>If the ſeaſon ſuit not to the Fancies of ſome, or Fears of others: I cannot help that: all ſuch may let it alone, 'tis obtruded on none, nor can a <hi>Paper</hi> of a ſingle <hi>Author</hi> (or Book) alarm any, ſave thoſe that are guilty: and ſuch, God<hi>'s</hi> Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets will ſting anon with fear, though I were ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:151110:6"/>
            <p>Did Jeremy forbear to write, Or <hi>Baruch</hi> to publiſh God's Word (though in time of wrath, and of his own Confinement) Jerem. <hi>33.2.33.1.</hi> Or after burning the rowle (by him that was moſt concernd) did he not publiſh a ſecond edition, with addition; Jer. <hi>36.</hi> laſt? though to <hi>Baruch</hi>'s ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard: and God brought them both off ſafe: in time of ſin and wrath, is the moſt need of a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full witneſs, that ſin being lamented, wrath may be prevented: and that <hi>City</hi> now was beſieged, <hi>Jeremiah</hi> confin'd from God's houſe; and it nigh a taking, and ſhutting up, (all fatall circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces) actjunct, with ruines on City and Temple ſhortly, by <hi>Babylon,</hi> and was it, or is it a time now to be dumb?</p>
            <p>Truely I fear by all the bad ſignes, boding evill, on any people before us; ſad events lye at the door by the flagitions crimes of men, the fearfull curſes of God, due for them. By the Courſe of the Orbes above, and the Counſels of men below, by the late <hi>Comets-portents,</hi> and the conſent of wilful men acceſſory to their own ruine, (that they may effect others) by all the predictions of God, and preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of ill men, by the Conſpiracies of Hell, and the Confuſions of Earth, by the Deaths, Diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Declenſions of the beſt, and diſtractions of all the reſt, Sacred or Civil: all things concenter to a tremendous <hi>Cataſtrophe.</hi> So that if <hi>Bp. Uſh</hi>—Propheſy of the In-let of <hi>Popery,</hi> or Dr. <hi>Th. T.</hi> (on one hand) may be heeded, or the dying words of a pious Reverend Dr. (Dr. <hi>S.W.</hi>) on the other hand: we may (as he) thrice cry out, <hi>Oh dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb facs="tcp:151110:7"/>Times!</hi> Yet the ſame Dr. a little after crys out again, thrice. <hi>O glorious Times!</hi> to the joy of all about him. And ſo the Scene-Tragical (at the Entrance) proves a Joy &amp; Comedy in the Exit.</p>
            <p>If any ſay, This Author writes ſceptically, in pleading for all, down to <hi>Quakers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To that I ſay, were I of none, or all Religions, it were to be abhorred: but to plead for all to have the Rights of Juſtice allowed the Body; and of Religion, allowed the Conſcience, is far from <hi>Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticiſme.</hi> I am not one in Faith and Worſhip, with all that I yet dare plead for, to give them the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the Conſciences, till God opens their eyes to ſee, and do better. I am far from them that will deny their Chriſtian Name to any, that deſire to deport ſuitably. 'Tis better to pray for them that are out of the way, than perſecute any in: for that makes them but Hypocrites in God's Service: Perſecution is but <hi>Antichriſts</hi> Broom, and it will never clean, or fill up Chriſt's Houſe.</p>
            <p>Do any alledge Peril or Charge, in publiſhing ſuch diſpleaſing Subjests. I ſay.</p>
            <p>For the 1ſt. 'tis an honourable Choice, to hazard <hi>Purſe</hi> or <hi>Perſon, Life</hi> and all, for the Truth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake: and in this the Author is loath to expoſe any with him: and he has not launc't out, I hope, paſt the Lines of Modeſty and Truth.</p>
            <p>This is not a Witneſs Saleable, ſo much as a free Dedication to the now diſperſed: as for the Charge, if Brethren be ingrateful for it, it is but the loſs of what is laboured hard for, and the loſs of others in like publick Service, and very like the Age we live in.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:151110:7"/>
            <p>If I am ask't, who called to this Apology? I anſwer, God and the Truth, and a wiſe King, <hi>Prov. 31.8.9.</hi> That twice bids, <hi>Open the mouth for the Dumb, the Sons of deſtruction, Poor &amp; Needy.</hi> This <hi>Plea</hi> becomes Kings to make for the Oppreſt, as <hi>Theodoric</hi> in <hi>Caffiod.</hi> that ought, <hi>Non tam armis, quam judiciis, ſieri clariores.</hi> That they ſhould not be more famous by Arms than Judgments. Truth has (as one ſays of the <hi>Rubie</hi>) two rare Properties: it is found not in the day, but (by its luſtre) in the Night; and that is ſuch, that whatever aray covers it, it ſhines through all. Truth ſhines beſt in the dark, and under the blackeſt Garb or Odium men can cloath it with. It is to be bought and valued above Rubies: and if none call to, or accept a Witneſs to it; yet 'tis re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and comfort ſufficient, to appeal to Chriſt that owns it, and will all its Lovers.</p>
            <p>If any ſay, <hi>But all's about a Controverſy?</hi> I yield, true, but it is a just Cauſe, a long depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Plea;</hi> and 'tis the Controverſy of <hi>Zion,</hi> and for purity of Worſhip, and to get &amp; keep out <hi>Roman</hi> Rites, and humane Ornature, that do alter its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, by Additions, and Traditious. Admit the Serpents Head, the Body eaſily winds in after: the Difference is but gradual (not ſpecific) 'twixt <hi>Romes</hi> Rites, and Home-Rites, the Plea of the Church-Authority, and Headſhip the ſame: 'tis Treaſon to ſteal, or alienate a Gemm, or ſo rich a Rubie) as Chriſt's Supremacy is. Not to plead this, is to deſert Chriſt's Cauſe, and Truth, and lay our own Profeſſion, Aſſemblies, and Countreys, open to a gaping Dragon.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:151110:8"/>
            <p>Now if any ſay, this <hi>Plea</hi> is too late, the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple you plead for, are gone, all the Flocks ſcatter'd. I anſwer, to any ſo inſulting, and ſay as <hi>Paul,</hi> to us all, <hi>Are they broken off—Boaſt not,</hi>

            <p>That nothing is more ſolmn to a pure and thinking ſoul than divine worſhip, any pyous mind will readily grant: and yet, through the Wrath of God and fury of Man, nothing more expoſed in all the parts and apurtinances of it; it was ſo here, Tyrants (ſay our Annotators) do not like Gods peoples Aſſemblies, and with them Doctor <hi>Mayer</hi> and <hi>Lyra</hi> agree, being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der tribute, they were forbid (to prevent rebell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion) at all to Aſſemble: and ſo they came up tho to there deſtruction. For be it ſuppoſed or real, the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> knew a meeting to pray, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, reform, was as pleaſing to God as fatal to them.</p>
            <p>Abulenſis, <hi>ſays, their generalia comitia in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicta fuere. Dr.</hi> Arrowſ. <hi>in Loc.</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:151110:12"/>And hence the old (and yet depending) ſtrife twixt <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel,</hi> as <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.4, 5. One acts in devotion well-pleaſingly; the other any how, and his works being not <hi>bonum, bene,</hi> good, well done, he lowers at God; and ſo kills <hi>Abel</hi> by club-law. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.12. This enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty (ſayes Biſhop <hi>Hall</hi>) <q rend="inline">is of God; yet <hi>Cains</hi> vice and murder of the Devil; all wrath is of one Author, to which to yeild, is to give place to the Devil. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.27. the occaſion is from Cods accepting <hi>Abel;</hi> Envy is the corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive of ill minds; he ſnarls that God and <hi>Abel</hi> are ſo good, it is an old but happy danger to be holy, that ſin Envy, is ever bloody in Act or Intent, ſo early Martydome was in the World, <hi>Abel</hi> dyes for pure Religion, ſo is made a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice;</q> ſo he. Hence is this quarrel, they could get no meeting at <hi>Mizpeh,</hi> but the evil eye of ſome Informes the Lords; and out do they go Armed, to Hector the Lord of Hoſts; the Ark had frighted them, and yet they will perſue it in cold blood; it ſlew them at home, yet they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue it abroad; they are forced to remit the Ark and yet now allow not the good uſe of it. In all ages the pureſt ſouls and ſervices were ſtil moſt liable to Hoſtility. <hi>Jſhmael</hi> mocks the promiſed Seed; <hi>Joſeph</hi> is a dreamer, the Archers ſhot at him <hi>Pharaoh</hi> calles it idle to crave freely to ſerve God, <hi>Exod.</hi> 5.8. the Archers of <hi>Jabin</hi> made a noiſe even in places of drawing waters, as <hi>Judges,</hi> 5.11. (be it natural or religious Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) <hi>Ariel</hi> may be diſtreſſed <hi>Iſaiah.</hi> 29.1. And
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:151110:13"/>Gods City beſieged, yea Chriſt himſelf preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is aſſaulted. <hi>Joh.</hi> 7.32, 45. And again in the Garden with Bands, Swords and Staves, the ſtone on the Sepulchre watcht to prevent Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection or ſtealth, <hi>Mat.</hi> 27. 64. Satan oft Reſiſteth Paul. The Witneſſes, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.5.9. muſt lye dead as ſuch <hi>(i.e.)</hi> Naturally or Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally ſo; and in a ſort they may be ſo in ſpirit too. Thus ſacred things are expoſed.</p>
            <p>This may come to paſs three wayes; either by the neglect of them on whom it is incumbent, Or the profane abuſe of the male adiniſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; or elſe by the open oppoſers of it; expreſſed ſo; Some, as <hi>Saul</hi> doing it avowedly, others un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſome pretended odium, by which they e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipſe and ſlander it. The laſt I intend the reſt I gently paſſe.</p>
            <p>As for the neglect of ſo ſacred a thing (if to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal) it argues groſe Ignorance or Atheiſtical contempt, or <hi>Scepticiſme,</hi> no Worſhip no Diety; ſo it produces a great Oblivion of Gods name, often ſo complained of, as <hi>Iſai.</hi> 65.11. <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.27.28. Of this <hi>Iſrael</hi> in <hi>Sauls</hi> time (I doubt by his meanes) was guilty; the Ark of God was obſolete then; they Inquired not at it, 1. <hi>Chron.</hi> 13.3. in <hi>Sauls</hi> Reing; yet in 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 14.19. <hi>Saul</hi> attempted it, for he bids <hi>Ahiah</hi> bring the Ark; but after bids him forbear, ſo did ſcarce ask, or ſtaid not for anſwer; and once forced himſelf to offer, but ſtaid not for <hi>Samuel;</hi> and in <hi>verſ.</hi> 37.41. he did ask a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain but did it amiſs, and ſo God anſwered not
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:151110:13"/>to his wrath and haſt: whether the neglect flowed from <hi>Saul</hi> that minded War more then Worſhip, or from the Peoples ſloth, that are ſtil apt to dance or ſleep to the Courts Pipe. <hi>Regis ad exemplum,</hi> This was the omiſſion all <hi>Sauls</hi> and Part of Davids Reign forty ſix years.</p>
            <p>Now this expoſes Divine worſhip and all ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred things to contempt, and Oblivion. Omiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are ſtill-born ſins, yet do cry and pull down Breaches, as in <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zahs</hi> caſe, 1 <hi>Chr.</hi> 15.2, 13. and God beares not well to ſee Duty neglected or done amiſs; That expoſes the Worſhip, this provokes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Pure Worſhip is expoſed by cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt or male Adminiſtrations: that antiquates it by diſuſe: This alienates God from it by abuſe of both the Object, and Inſtitution; that makes it nothing, this another thing; that Subjects it to Mans will (do or not do) this to Gods Wrath for our miſs-doing. Now Gods Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are changed, Laws violate, and ſo Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances and Covenants broke, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 24.5. To miſs the Object, the Order, Way and manner of Adoration, is to defile and vitiate the thing, break <hi>Second</hi> and <hi>Third</hi> Command; and make it all vain. It is done by Addition or Detraction. by Innovation or Invaſion upon it; of this Kings, Preiſts and others have been guilty in Scripture time, and ſince.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Kings have intruded on Gods Altar, &amp; layd by their Scepter for the Cenſer. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ziah</hi> being ſtrong and his heart up-lift to his fall, the ſight
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:151110:14"/>of the brazen Altar ſuffices not, he'll attempt the golden to offer incenſe, 2 <hi>Chr.</hi> 26.16, 19. The Act was good, but the Agent bad, and not conſecrated for it; the Prieſts (tho but Subjects) were both above and againſt the King in that, it was the perſons Arrogancy; not the Power, but the vitions pride that <hi>Azariah</hi> and thoſe eighty valiant Preiſts, bravely withſtood. Nay one ſayes the City was poluted and robbed of propheſie becauſe they detruded him not. <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſephus</hi> adds, then was an Earthquake; and the Temple was rent, a beam of Light ſo flaſhed on his face, that the Leproſie preſently fell on him; he that went open-faced to the Altar, that without the gold-plate of <hi>Holineſs,</hi> the very Prieſt durſt not do, is ſmote with a ſhamefull Plague, and ſo ſecluded for ever from men: for that ſo daring an approach to God, unduely. Thus the Worſhip of God was expoſed to Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence; he that by place ought to defend it, is a profane Intruder, forfeits Crown and Scepter, to uſe the Cenſer; by incenſe inflames wrath; ſets his will above Gods; deems his perſon under as high and ſacred an Unction, as High Prieſt; as Biſhop <hi>Hall</hi> ſayes, <hi>His ſoveranity is too high to be checked by a ſubject: and as he ſpeaks, God ſmites, it is a fooliſh and bold miſpriſion, to think that being great on earth, we may be bold with hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; when Gods meſsengers counſel, intreat, and threaten in vain, it is time for God to ſhow imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate judgments; wilful offenders muſt look for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but fearful revenge; affecting the Alter, loſt
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:151110:14"/>him his Throne;</hi> So he. Let that <hi>Pontifex maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus of Rome</hi> ſee and tremble, and all his ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors that ſo invade Gods Alter, not to offer but ſit in the ſide of the Congregation to hinder them that would ſerve and ought: know ye the ſcab is in its frontles front, the right eye is darkened and the crys of the Alter defiled with blood and violence, are gone up before the Lord God of <hi>Zaboth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But of all the daring expoſals of Worſhip to injury, and alteration, no Prince paſſed <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> that is therefore ſo oft ſaid to make <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſin: for coming in ſmooth and by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of divine unction, upon <hi>Rehoboams</hi> tyranny and <hi>Iſraels</hi> revolt, he layes the bottom of his Throne upon the ſpring of Idolatry, and as ſlily makes the inſinuation plauſible to <hi>Iſraels</hi> caſe. He pleads thus: <hi>If they return to God, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not long be mine, I muſt divert them from</hi> Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, <hi>or I ſhall not live, and reigne: I may change (tho not inhibit) Religion. They</hi> (ſaies Hall) <hi>ſhall have the ſame God;</hi> with <hi>formality, to eaſe them, I'll humour them,</hi> (as <hi>Aaron</hi>) with two Calves of Gold, and now 'tis no <hi>Calves,</hi> no <hi>King,</hi> he muſt needs know Idolatry rent ten parts off to him, and yet will uſe profane poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies to promote his Kingdom by it. He knew Images were forbid, and rival Altars to Gods, at the Temple: yet dares to innovate for ſettlement of his Throne. And what follows, ſee <hi>H. Anſworth,</hi> his Plea, and now he makes
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:151110:15"/>bold with Gods Law, <hi>No ſooner the Calves are up, but ten Tribes are down on their Knees: the vulgar ſoon are carry'd to the Religion of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,</hi> (as the Vane veirs about, under the Crown) now Altars, Temples, Services, Prieſts, Feaſts, all are new: <hi>Egypt</hi> is brought to <hi>Bethel,</hi> Calves fixt for Gods, and Bruits adore them: Beggars made Prieſts to both, new holy-day-Feaſts are preſcrib'd, not out of the Law, but the device of his Heart; and on the tother hand, the diviſion of ten Tribes ratified, the way bored for <hi>Omri's</hi> Statutes, all the Devout diſcouraged, the beſt Prieſts and Levites ejected (and ſo dead in Law) that had any devotion for God's Temple; Inſtituted things antiquitated, and alſo Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity urged for a rule of Worſhip, and the ſnares of malicious Prieſts laid, and Malitia Troops ſet on <hi>Tabor</hi> and <hi>Miſpeh</hi> (by conſent) to Rob and Kill, as <hi>Hoſea</hi> 5.1, 10, 11, 6.8, 9. and hinders the Upright in going to worſhip a great Type; and a fatal caution to later times, that have by Papal Tyranny, and her Siſter Idolatry not done ſo, but worſe, that now 'tis come to it, the Scepter and the Cenſer (as two Pitchers) ſo claſh, that one ſurely muſt crack, man's Crown, or Chriſt's Mitre.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Now are Prieſts, and that Tribe of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour Levites, leſs guilty of Prophaning God's Altar, and ſo expoſing it to Injury and Violation? For to inſtance in a few (and ſome the beſt) If <hi>Aaron</hi> himſelf (that Saint of the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:151110:15"/>Lord) was ſo ſoon wheedled by the rude Rabble, as in <hi>Exod.</hi> 32.1.5. to invocate <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovah</hi> in, and by a golden Calf; ſo like to <hi>Egypt,</hi> croſs to that Law, <hi>Moſes</hi> now was gone for, baſely unfit to repreſent God: no wonder others of leſs ſight and ſanctity, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varicate in like kind, but it coſt them Blood, three Thouſand; him reproof; it, ſtamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to powder; <hi>Moſes</hi> grief; the Tabernacle a remove; and a Tang or Spice of that Calf in all Succeſſions. That Injury may the high Arch-Prieſts do to the Lord's Name, if in ſacred things they inſtead of God's will, conſult and act their own, or others.</p>
            <p>But herein <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu</hi> were tardy and ſtumbled at the threſhold; for no ſooner was the Worſhip fixt, and God's Fire illap'ſt (to teach them what Sacrifice pleaſed) but they Err at firſt in uſing common for that ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Fire, <hi>Levit.</hi> 9. <hi>ult.</hi> 10, 1, 2. Offering to impoſe on God their Wills, for his Word; and, as if it were a good plea to ſay, <hi>Where is it forbid?</hi> whilſt he had not ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, (ver. 1.) and to ſhow how fatal 'tis to ignore a rule in Worſhip, God blaſts them both with ſtrange Fire too: Hall <hi>calls it, a careleſs Preſumption to ſerve God with common Flame, as if he might not chuſe the Forms of his own appointment, when we bring Zeal without Knowledge, Carnal Affections, Miſconceits for Faith, devices of our will Worſhips, and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious Devotions to God; that is ſtrange Fire
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:151110:16"/>he hates, both Altar, Fire, Prieſt and Offering: So fatal 'tis to decline God's Inſtitutions, he oft revenges our doing what is not required.</hi> And ſo ſtruck ſome now, to warn all after.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zah's</hi> ſinſul contact of the bare Ark might ſeem leſs criminal or venial, but by the fatal ſudden death, ſeems of as deep a Dye; and dye he did for it, in 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6.7. and that juſt for his Errour: <hi>Verſ.</hi> 7. But ſee the Raſhneſs and Preſumption of the whole matter, the Ark and he both are out of their place, <hi>uno errore poſito ponuntur mille;</hi> it ſhould have been born on the Prieſt's Shouldiers, by Law, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15.13. and he placed a bearer of the meaner Utenſils; ſo <hi>David</hi> after recognized to the Prieſts; So the omiſſion in the firſt led on to preſumption in that touch at laſt, and both uſher on death on one <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zzah,</hi> but as a ſtroke on them all, to caution us (in them) all, not to temerate ſacred Myſteries, leaſt we expoſe that Act to wrath, by which we ſeek fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, and the Agent to death; or the Ark to privacy, which is no ſmall injury to Worſhip.</p>
            <p>The two Sons of <hi>Ely</hi> (and he relatively) were not a little guilty of Injury to the Lord's offerings, &amp; that many wayes: perſonally, they had ſcandalous Vices, were Sons of <hi>Belial,</hi> knew not God, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.12. minded their Bellies, and pleaſing their Pallates, not at all to pacify God, made ſurrogates of their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants with a tridentine Hook <hi>(i.e.)</hi> Hunger, Rapine, Force, to ſtrike in the Pot, and gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandize
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:151110:16"/>all they got. So all that came to offer were ſerved, and the Gut muſt be ſerved e're God too; ſo that the People were ſque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed by it, and content to put in their Mouthes, to avoid force (as is ſaid, <hi>Micah</hi> 3.5.) <hi>verſ.</hi> 13.-16. So that hence the Offerings (ſo great was their Sins before the Lord) was even ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred of men, <hi>verſ.</hi> 17. which was unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, though not commendable, for ſacred Offerings, while they anſwered the end, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more acceptable, but if corrupted by Male-adminiſtrators, (as theſe two were, the Sons of <hi>Ely</hi>) who can expect clear Water through polluted and poyſoned Conduits? Their Lives belyed their Lips, like the Prieſts of degenerate times, that taught the way to Heaven, went to Hell, were directers to others in Rights, but ſtill neglecters of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemlves in Subſtantials; thought it good to ſay, <hi>Do as I ſay, not as I do.</hi> When alas! the vulgar (as <hi>Seneca</hi> obſerved) <hi>Plus vivitur exemplis quam preſcriptis;</hi> Thus the worſhip was violated and people naſeated, yea, the Women vitiated (at the Door openly) and the Ark of God at laſt, his ſtrength and glory given to the <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> and that (for about forty ſix Years) ſo diſſettled it, and all regular or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted Worſhip, that till the Ark is on <hi>Zion,</hi> no old Tent is fit to lodge it; it will ſooner retire in a private Houſe, that is an injury to God's publick Ordinances.</p>
            <p>One way more I inſtance (in that both <hi>Ahaz</hi>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:151110:17"/>the King, and <hi>

                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ziah</hi> (<hi>ch.</hi> 26.19. —) nor like to himſelf, once a faithful Witneſs, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8.2.) but as a vile Apoſtate) more ſinfully obeys a mandate implied, in a pattern ſent of a new-faſhioned Altar, and he makes it ready, ſo complies with a double Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of <hi>Ahaz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Innovoting a forreign Form, an Altar from abroad, on which himſelf firſt offers.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Antiquating the Lord's brazen Altar (in a corner) as Obſolete, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 16.12, 15, 16. a Sin aggravated, firſt by the time in his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs, when he moſt needed God's help to ſave.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> By the ſenſe God put on it, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28.23. he calls it a ſacrificing to the Gods of <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> that yet help't him not at all; ſo is branded as that <hi>Ahaz,</hi> and it, grew alſo to other Injuries (of which afterward) in ſecluding of Worſhippers, ſo aggravating the guilt by higher acts of Violence. Oh! for a man in ſtraitneſs to ſin more! beaten and ſlighted abroad, to ſerve the Gods that diſtreſs
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:151110:17"/>him; to induce a Devotion that devours his Treaſures, to help a King that plotted his, and his Subjects ruin, is at the ſame time to make the People naked, and himſelf to put on both Obcaecation and Induration of heart; this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked God to bring <hi>Judah</hi> low, <hi>verſ.</hi> 19. nor does any thing lore our Sails more than to deprave and injure Gods worſhip; ſo God's worſhip is often expoſed.</p>
            <p>Now I conclude this kind of Injury to God's Inſtitutions by <hi>Pellican's</hi> Allegory, (cited by <hi>Mayr.</hi> in <hi>loc.</hi>) pag. 256. <hi>That by</hi> Urijahs <hi>ſtrange Altar, ſays, Such vile Miniſters (to pleaſe wicked Princes) that do bring on the Church ſtrange Doctrines and Rites of Worſhip, do act over again this baſe Temporizer, ſet aſide the Lord's Altar on the Nortis, and place in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of it one to the Devil; ſo God's Word is put on the left Hand (ſo is the North) and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Inventions drawn from the</hi> Gentiles <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to it.</hi> And he after cites <hi>Theodoret.</hi> That enumerates ſix Heads of <hi>Ahaz</hi> guilt, to caution Kings not to ſin like him, that was ſo plagued by the <hi>Edomites,</hi> whoſe Gods he ſerved.</p>
            <p>The third way of expoſing God's Service, is by direct and open acts of Hoſtility; ſo men proceed from ill to worſe, not only neglect and prophane it, but reſiſt and propugue it, and the Upright obſervers of it, with all the Mediums and Seaſons of it. As the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity of a true Worſhipper is beſt ſeen, ſo the Enmity of a Maligner, both of the Act and Agent, moſt appears in its being expoſed
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:151110:18"/>to Violence. As the Wicked are haters of God, his knowledge, will and wayes, ſo of his Service, and the purer, the more its ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligned: So are they of all that love or keep them, and ſo God's worſhip is violented

In ſhort, (alas!) when Superiours are a Terror to good deeds and doers, and a praiſe to the evil, the Sword is born in vain, or ſadly perverted in and from the end its given unto. So when inferiour Judges, and Miniſters of Juſtice, practiſe the Law partial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to feed Rapine and malicious Harpies; it diſcourages the Pious, and ſober minds. Thus men are haled before the Seats of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as <hi>Acts</hi> 8.3. only for Praying; and others are draged to Priſons, and only for Conſcience of duty to God, the Truth, and the good of Souls: The violent courſes of this ſort beggars the Vertuous, and ſo gratifies In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers, that live on Spoils, but no way dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies

            <p n="2">2d. <hi>Doctrine,</hi> was to aſſault worſhip in the Act, is fearful and fatal Guilt.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Philiſtims</hi> in the late captivating of Gods Ark, were not a little guilty; but though ignorant of God, it was unproſperous wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, and for it, had he whipt their Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors, (or hinder parts) as 'tis <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.66. to their endleſs ſhame, and forced them to ſend it home with Kine and Peace-Offerings; nor did it fare well with the <hi>Bethſhemites</hi> for their irreverent temerity in gazing, that knew better: Now for them to dare it on a new aſſault abroad, ſince it had beat them ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely at home, (in each City, to which it went the round) till it forced its own reſcue; I ſay, for them now in Gods Ground, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade (106 Miles, was poſſibly ſtrange.)

            <p>But on this I need not be large, what Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults, and how many Injuries Gods Service lies expoſed to; who are the Agreſſor is done already in the 1ſt <hi>Doct.</hi> what is to be given in Caution, that they who are in the act, may without fear or diſtraction, do their Duty, and inſtances of Gods wrath may occur on the third point.

            <p>The Point is true, tho not univerſal, and to it I ſay, one way or other, firſt or laſt, moſt certain: ſoon or late God ſtands up for his Service and Worſhippers; the Point is liable to <hi>Objection,</hi> but not <hi>Contradiction;</hi> the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions are to be weighed, the thing is,

One ſays, this Peace never was had: but that is to call Truth it ſelf in doubt: yes, he did ſo, many years together; and yet the Moral of it extends to our latter days; for if legal Rites and Feſtivities were grac't by ſuch Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes then, Goſpel Worſhip obtains far greater and better Promiſes; and though
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:151110:38"/>they often had ill and envious Neighbours; yet I doubt not, one way or other God ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Worſhippers; and (at leaſt) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended it, and all the means of it, from vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence; or ſhortly plagued the violation of it.</p>
            <p>But a fuller proof yet is in <hi>Iſai.</hi> 29.7. <hi>v.</hi> 1. predicts a Wo, a diſtreſs threatned to <hi>Ariel;</hi> and yet <hi>v.</hi> 7. is a Promiſe to it: <hi>1ſt.</hi> diſtreſs by an Enemy, <hi>(Viz.)</hi> the <hi>Aſſyrian,</hi> that beſieged the City and Mount of God, as the Hebrew word is (by ſome) Or the <hi>Lion</hi> (ſo <hi>Arr</hi> properly notes) of God: Oh but how is the Deliverance of <hi>Ariel?</hi> The diſtreſs, <hi>Vatablus</hi> ſays, by the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> (or rather the <hi>Babylonian</hi>) is predicted to be doleful: <hi>Plurima cadavera circum Altare jacent.</hi>

            <pb n="58" facs="tcp:151110:39"/>
            <p>Other Proofs occur in the ſequel. One more I cite, <hi>Act.</hi> 18.9.10. <hi>Paul</hi> by Viſion is incouraged by promiſed ſucceſs in his duty: 1. His Fears are allayed; next is a promiſe of reſtraint, that none ſhould ſet on him to hurt him. 3. The Preſence of God is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt, a ſweet advantage and a terrour to his Foes. 4. God pleads title to his People (not yet called) the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> Though he is thruſt out of the publick <hi>Synagogue,</hi> he gets <hi>Juſtus</hi>'s private Houſe. Worſhips there, and teaches, and gathers a People to God.</p>
            <p>So that by this it is clear, God left that Church (as National) to a malicious perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting of the Goſpel; and <hi>Paul</hi> does ſo too, to enjoy Gods Preſence for a defence in Gods Work; and by the whole 'tis manifeſt, God is a Munition to his own Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To explain it more particularly, both when, how, or by what means he doth it; and why?</p>
            <p>Now the Lord, that beſt ſees his own times, methods and mediums, by which to make good his promiſe, protects his ſervants, either,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Before, by way of <hi>Prevention;</hi> or,</p>
            <p>

            <p>

            <p>The ſubſequent Inſtances (to be remarkt)
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:151110:39"/>are reducible to one of theſe. Beſides, he has ſometimes ordinary ways to do it in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Providence (and they not obtaining) often he has ſuperordinary, or miraculous ways to effect it. Yet once, God may preſerve the pure Worſhippers in perſon as in <hi>Elijah</hi>'s time, in Caves, when the Altars are all furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly dug up: And ſo may he preſerve his Houſe, Tent and Altar, and yet expoſe the Ark and Prieſthood (as in <hi>Eli</hi>'s ſons day) to Captivity: Or may ſtop one <hi>Zachary</hi>'s mouth, not all; or caſt Altar and all off, a while: But uſually he meaſures Altar, Worſhip, and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippers, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.1, 2. for preſervation, and repair.</p>
            <p>Now the firſt Defence is by <hi>Prevention of Evil intended;</hi> God ſits in Council among the Gods; foreſees, detects, and diverts them, ſometimes reſtrains the men, or reproves them for his Prophets ſakes. So (<hi>Gen.</hi> 20.) he did <hi>Abime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lech</hi> for <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſake, a righteous man, and a Prophet (as he's called) and Gods Friend. So they that bordered <hi>Iſrael</hi> of old, were kept from deſiring their Land, in times of ſolemn Worſhip, or Feaſts of the Lord. So <hi>Saul</hi> is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted by a timous Providence; Tydings comes of an Invaſion of the <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.26, 27. elſe had he been caught: But God gave a <hi>Selah,</hi> or Rock of Diremption. So <hi>Juli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> by the <hi>Parthian</hi> War. And <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>Fifth,</hi> by the <hi>Turks</hi> Inrode to <hi>Hungary.</hi> Mr. <hi>Fox</hi> tells that one Juſtice <hi>Gilford,</hi> going up ſtairs
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:151110:40"/>force Mrs. <hi>Roberts</hi> to Maſs, was then took by a fit of the <hi>Gout,</hi> and ſo tortured, he ſwore he would trouble her no more. The Prophet is ſent for by two Captains and their fifties, but yet they miſs their morſel. <hi>Eliſha,</hi> at <hi>Dothan,</hi> to be ſeized by a Band of Horſemen, as 2 <hi>King.</hi> 6.18. but is by Angels ſaved, they prevented. Some way, like to it alſo, was <hi>Athanaſius</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, and the cruel Cut-throats put by: Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of Miſchief is pure Mercy. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> eſcaped in the way where he was going to Preach; the Lyers in wait loſt their End, he looſing his way. Thus the Officers ſent to take Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 7.26, 32. being convict in hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſt, civilly dropt off, and brought him not, <hi>v.</hi> 44, 46.</p>
            <p>One <hi>Hen. Zutphen</hi> (a Preacher at <hi>Breme</hi>) the Catholicks ſent oft to entrap him, and as well they proſpered; for the moſt of them were convinced, or converted, openly owning his word to be the Truth of God, undeniable, and what they heard not before; perſwading them that ſent them ſo to believe and be ſaved. Thus the Catchers were caught, <hi>Popiſh Envy</hi> prevented, Soules Converted, and Truth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed.</p>
            <p>A ſecond way of Defence about Worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, is, when in the very act of duty, God does either help them to go on, or elſe hides them from the preſent danger.</p>

            <p n="2">2. For God by his Providence to hide his Worſhippers a while, is one thing; that is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten. For men (without Precepts, or againſt them) to huddle up the Worſhip it ſelf, is doubted.</p>
            <p>Again, 3. For men to be expelled, expoſed, and exiled from God's Houſe, Word, Work, Worſhip, as <hi>Jer.</hi> 36.5. and ſupply it by the Pen, as he, is one thing: To be voluntary, ſelf exiles, to ſhut up our ſelves in ſolitude, and leave our Duty tamely, is another.</p>
            <pb n="67" facs="tcp:151110:43"/>
            <p>Once more. To be ſcattered is the Adverſaries ſin, that alſo is our ſorrow; to diſperſe in fear, without force (actual and military) is our ſin. A bare Law could not looſe Daniel from his homage to God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. By <hi>Poſition</hi> I conclude on 4 points for <hi>Anſwer.</hi> 1. Gods Law and Power is only ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute and arbitrary: Our Obedience is firſt due to God; to man (in him) only, and (againſt him) not at all, <hi>Act.</hi> 4.18, 19.5.29. In the <hi>1ſt.</hi> place the query is put to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil: in the <hi>2d.</hi> is a <hi>Poſition</hi> what ought to be.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Gods Word, and Goſpel-Worſhip ought to be open; the outward Court of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple had no Covert; as Chriſt did, ſo we ſhould ſpeak openly, as oppoſed to fear, or to ſecrecy. Chriſt and Goſpel Worſhip are publick Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, not only for Saints edifying: but (which is a nobler uſe) for Sinners converting. The <hi>Temple</hi> was on a Hill; the <hi>Eaſt-gate</hi> three times higher than the Houſe; the Brazen <hi>Altar</hi> ſet juſt before the Out-Court, all muſt look on the exhibiting of Sacred Miſteries; the Goſpel ought not to be carried as ſtollen Goods, under the Cloak, to be a ſhame to it by our Walks, or aſhamed of it in our Worſhip, is to incur a Wo and Curſe, <hi>Mark</hi> 8.38.</p>
            <p n="3">3. 'Tis ignoble to looſe ground, valliantly won by Chriſt's Worthies: not like the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies of <hi>David</hi> of old, that defended a Plat of <hi>Lentiles,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.11, 12. and ſo got a
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:151110:44"/>great Victory; we are unworthy Bankrupts to let go too eaſily, that noble footing Chriſt and brave old Apologiſts for the Word, lately wan us; and what is gained from our Foes by Providence.</p>
            <p n="4">4. To fear, or flee, or faint in our Duty, is ſin; tho it be to hide in the Temple, as <hi>Nehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah,</hi> ch. 6.13. was preſt and tempted to do (and that was the Place of worſhip) but refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to leave a publick Duty for private Safety. Our Lord and ſome others have fled, but an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample is not a warrant to act, or deſiſt (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Precept) that is our ſet Rule.</p>
            <p>I confeſs modern Practice, riſing from ſervile fear, ſelf-ends, and ſave-skin Doctrine, has (through late Cuſtome) obtained ſome Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, on moſt, to private retirements, ſome to gratifie <hi>Peters</hi> humour; Mr. Pitty to thy ſelf <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

<pb n="69" facs="tcp:151110:44"/>and fall in the mouths of Lions (and men worſe) for a criticiſme of time, or a Rite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicity? no, not ſo. Where had the Promiſe been in 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 6.38. given to <hi>Solomons</hi> Prayer reſpecting that Temple? and his Simplicity; where the boldneſs of a Prophet for God, the glory of his Profeſſion, and Gods miraculous Salvation, as alſo his Faith been?

            <p>If any alledge <hi>Iſai.</hi> 8.16. as a Precept to us; know, it prohibits the <hi>Word</hi> to be Preacht to Scoffers any more, that ſlight it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.6. or reject it, as <hi>Acts</hi> 13.46. Not unto thoſe that loved and longed after it; to all ſuch it was to be ſealed, for ſafety and Secrecy as their Right.</p>
            <p>Do you urge that Chriſt, in <hi>John,</hi> 12,36. did go and hide himſelf. <hi>Sol.</hi> what our Lord did, is not matter of Precept to us in all things: and this teaches us, that after the day of his Grace paſt, it is juſt the things of our peace ſhould be hid from our Eyes, as <hi>Luke</hi> 19.42, 43, 44. but he ſpeaks not of our hiding at all.</p>
            <p>And for that of the Diſciples, <hi>John</hi> 20.19. being aſſembled, and the Doors ſhut for fear of the <hi>Jews;</hi> may not we do ſo? To that I ſay, all the Diſciples did, is not a Law for our Imitation; that of aſſembling was good, and our Pattern; we are not here to forſake Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies of Saints, as <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.25. But in their
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:151110:45"/>fear (if ſinful, we are not to follow them: all it ſhews, is, the <hi>Jews</hi> were oppoſite, and to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void (what in them lay) being obnoxious to their Envy or Fury, they ſhut the Doors either weakly, or warily; for a cauſe of cautious fear there was; they had killed their Maſter, and would not ſurely ſpare the Diſciples; 'twas meet to hold them faſt without; he that was Lord of the Sabbath being roſe, and to change it to firſt day, on this day comes among them; allays fears, ſpeaks peace, and commiſſions them with Power: and after we find them in every houſe, but more in the <hi>Temple</hi> and <hi>Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues,</hi> telling of his Reſurrection, as <hi>Acts</hi> 1.13.2.1.3.1.4.1. and even after an eſcape again in the <hi>Temple,</hi> ch, 5.25. Being now got above all Fears. Worſhippers may be hid (in their Duty) but the opener that Goſpel-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip is, the better; though in Perils.</p>
            <p>To cure Miniſters Fears, the Story of one Mr. <hi>James Faber</hi> of <hi>Piccardy</hi> is very pregnant, who being fled for the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, at a Dinner with ſome of note;<note place="margin">Scripture fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>p. 460.</hi>
               </note> weeping ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, gives this reaſon; <hi>That his ſin was great, that being</hi> 100 <hi>years old, and had ſo long preacht the Goſpel to others, who had ſuffered for it, he, as an unconſtant Doctor ſhould now flee;</hi> and ſhed many tears: a little after ſaid, <hi>the Maſter called for him:</hi> made his Will inſtantly, and ſhortly laid him aſleep, and died.</p>
            <pb n="71" facs="tcp:151110:45"/>
            <p>Now to end this head, let us only note the care that in particular God ſhows of his Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, (partly) ſecuring his Witneſſes (partly) the Aſſemblies.</p>
            <p>For the <hi>1ſt.</hi> as Scriptures give Inſtances in <hi>Jeremy,</hi> ſo in <hi>Paul, Acts</hi> 19. 30. Here <hi>Paul</hi> (de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted a <hi>Martyr</hi>) is by Diſciples preſerved from the <hi>Theatre.</hi> I note, they uſing Gods means, did well, for <hi>Paul</hi>'s ſafety; 'tis laudable (in the Godly) to be cary of the Lifes and Uſes of God's Witneſſes: and ſo he eſcap't alſo <hi>Are<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas</hi> his fury in <hi>Damaſcus</hi> by a Basket, they let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him down over the Wall, as 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.33. There his Converſion and Miniſtry began; there, <hi>Acts.</hi> 9.20, 23. the <hi>Jews</hi> lay wait to kill him; to eſcape the Aſſaſſinates and Souldiers, he flees. All flight is not ſinful, and God had work for him abroad; they were his Reſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</p>
            <p>A Senator of <hi>Hala</hi> gave <hi>Brentius</hi> advice, that ſome conſpired his death, and bids, <hi>Fuge, fuge, Brenti — cito,</hi> &amp;c. O <hi>Brent</hi> flee, go quickly. So an Angel (in an Old Man's Form) came to an Inn where ſeveral were in Company, and gave notice of the <hi>Emperours</hi> Order at hand to ſecure one <hi>Gryneus;</hi> he is no ſooner gone, but in comes the Officer, but found him not. So Mr. <hi>T. H.</hi> of <hi>N. E.</hi> coming down as the Officer came up, askt him if Mr. <hi>H.</hi> be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove; ſaid <hi>H.</hi> yes, he was but now in that Room; ſo God blinds Malice often, and hides
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:151110:46"/>his own in the hollow of his hand, as 'tis <hi>Iſai.</hi> 51.16. and ſo will it ever be with us (as with our Lord) till our hour appointed of God; as Chriſt was ſtill preſerved, ſo are his Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, till (as Lambs) they be fit for the Altar.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2dly.</hi> Nor leſs care ſhows the Lord in a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert, ſpread on Aſſemblies. 'Tis next to a wonder in nature, that <hi>Lions, Wolves, Foxes,</hi> are ſo few, and yet bring forth <hi>Cubbs</hi> by 4 or 5 at once; but Sheep that breed only at Spring, and ſeldom above one or two, are increaſt dayly by Flocks, though cut off for Sacrifices (often) and Food; dayly quartered, fleeced, flayed, on every <hi>Shambles.</hi> And yet 'tis a far greater wonder, that <hi>Wolviſh, Men,</hi> and their <hi>Puppets,</hi> more ten to one, eſpecially on perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting days, than be the Saints, ſhould not (long ago) have utterly extirpated all the Seed of God: but ſtill to increaſe the wonder, the Race of Gods Seekers (the Affections and Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies both) are dayly increaſed, even in Times and Places of the greateſt Rage and Voracity.

            <p>Now all I urge hence, is to prove that God is the Safety of Aſſemblies in worſhip of his Name: and though <hi>Objections</hi> may be made and anſwered in the Sequel; yet if God be as good as his word (as oft he is better) and if yet any remain of <hi>Zions</hi> Daughters, he is the ſame defence yeſterday, to day, and for ever, as <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.8. Modern Inſtances will yet further occur from Hiſtory, to prove <hi>(ex abundanti)</hi> the truth of it. And ſo far is the <hi>2d.</hi> head in the Act of Duty, how Gods defends his Worſhip.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>3dly.</hi> Now let's explain how God defends his Worſhippers afterwards: Tho it may be the Lot of the beſt to be expoſed, and God in his Wiſdom (for good and holy ends) ſuffers
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:151110:48"/>the worſt of Men to prevail over the beſt, and to trample on the moſt ſacred things, and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; moſt (for his own times and ways he muſt take, to perform his Word, not ours) yet after men have proſpered a long time, and Saints ſuffered with and for the <hi>Sanctuary,</hi> a little while, he comes <hi>(a tergo)</hi> unawares, after the one with Vengeance, and unto the Godly rides faſt for their help and deliverance. There is none like the God of <hi>Jeſhurun</hi> (ſaid <hi>Moſes</hi>) Deut. 33.26. that is, of Upright Ones, <hi>that rides on the Heavens for thy help, and in his Excellency on the Skies.</hi> Note,</p>
            <p n="1">1. God is titled by the ſtile of a General, his Excellency, for he excells in Might, in Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, in Command ore all in chief.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Though he delays, and is long and far behind our haſty deſires, yet 'tis but as a Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that ſteps to the Rere to bring them ſafe off; and he is not diſmounted, he rides ſtill, and on ſwift Steeds, the Skies, the Heavens, which Spheres do naturally move wondrous quick; ſo that he can ſoon overtake the foot of his Hoſt, and alſo the Horſe of his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies. 'Tis a Note of<note n="*" place="margin">Burr.

            <pb n="77" facs="tcp:151110:48"/>
            <p>To be a little more particular in this third head; How God defends his Worſhipers af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, tho in the act of duty he may delay a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſpace of time, to try both their courage, and patience, and perſeverance in well doing; and herein he helps them alſo not a little; and that is alſo a token of their Salvation.</p>
            <p>But now as the after-clap Thunder is loudeſt, and that which brings the Bolt of Execution on the higheſt things: So</p>
            <q>
               <l>Does Gods fulminating Stroaks,</l>
               <l>On Baſhans higheſt ſturdy Oaks,</l>
               <l>And lofty Hills, <hi>as</hi> Pſal. <hi>81.7.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>— feriunt ſummos fulmina montes.</l>
            </q>
            <p>That <hi>Pſalm</hi> ſays of <hi>Iſraels</hi> Deliverance out of <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Slavery, <hi>He anſwered in the ſecret place of Thunder. (i.e.)</hi> by ſore and heavy Judgments on <hi>Aegypt, Exod.</hi> 9.23. And this not the leaſt; for as the Thunder terrified them, and the <hi>Hail</hi> and <hi>Fire</hi> mixt, ſmote <hi>Graſs, Herbs</hi> and <hi>Trees,</hi> ſo that, <hi>v.</hi> 28. the King melts and thaws a while; and at <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Prayer it was removed again: but the Heart freezes as hard as before, to inſlave God's Children, till the <hi>Red-Sea</hi> ſoakt it once for all.</p>
            <p>Nor are extraordinary Examples of this wanting here (when no ordinary obtain) ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times God's Cannons go off, and the Report
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:151110:49"/>and Execution, is done at ſome diſtance, and heard of afterwards; ſometimes it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately; and ſo here: on that day (<hi>v.</hi> 10.) he diſcomfited them: poſſibly ſentence is not ſpeedily — as <hi>Eccl.</hi> 8.11. It may be, at Night, as in the Siege of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> propheſied <hi>Iſai.</hi> 17.14. performed, <hi>ch.</hi> 37.36. and that Night too, as to the Hoſt. and <hi>v.</hi> 38. (as to the King) verified, and even in the act of his own Worſhip (it ſeems) in the Houſe of his falſe God, his Sons (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps) in a Jealouſie of being prevented in the Succeſſion, ſlew him, and ſo he that did invade and beſiege Gods City and Sanctuary, is cut off in his own, to read us his Crime in his own condemnation. <hi>Polibius</hi> ſaid of <hi>Antiochus,</hi> he came to that ill end for at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting to ſpoil <hi>Apollo</hi>'s Temple; it was indeed for this aſſaulting of Gods. For, (<hi>v.</hi> 34.) is a Promiſe to defend that Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty as a Shield. (ſo the Word notes) <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodotus</hi> ſays of this defeat<note n="*" place="margin">Tho miſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to <hi>Setho,</hi> Prieſt of <hi>Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can.</hi>
               </note> and death (ſoon after) that on his Tomb was found that Epitaph, <hi>Look on me and beware.</hi>

            <p>And for Cities and Towns (corporate, or not) no leſs Jealouſy does he conceive (and in time vent) againſt the Abuſers of Holy Things: a little will ſufficiently Inſtance it.</p>

            <p>If <hi>Jericho</hi>'s Repair, (whoſe Fall was by the Arm of Faith) intail'd a Curſe on him, and his, that ſhould rebuild it: what deſerves it to build up (not <hi>Zion,</hi> but) <hi>Babel,</hi> on her Ruins?

<pb n="91" facs="tcp:151110:55"/>was found: <hi>Here lies the City that periſh'd with Silence.</hi> So for that Head.</p>
            <p>But Scripture yet adduces more matter to amplify this, by ſome apt Metaphors that do open this: how God defends us, <hi>(i.e.)</hi> As a Bird, a Shadow, a Shepherd, a Wall of Fire, or a Camp, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of which a little to each.</p>
            <p n="1">1. As Birds <hi>Iſa.</hi> 31.5. flying, ſo will the Lord of Hoſts defend <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> defending he will deliver, and paſſing over, preſerve it. The ſcope is to hearten the Faithful 'gainſt all Fear, by various Arguments: two eſpecially, 1. The promiſe of Defence: (<hi>verſ.</hi> 5.) 2. The Preſence of God, and the Fire of his Altar burning in <hi>Zion:</hi> as Dr. <hi>Mayer</hi> obſerves, the former among others is illuſtrate by a Simile of Birds flying; that denotes either, 1. That Birds on the Wing were not ſo much in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger as on the Earth, where Snares lye: So they by a flight to God, on the Wing of Faith, might get above all Adverſaries, without the Snare, that truſt in <hi>Egypt;</hi> or human help, brings. So the Net was in vain ſpread for 'em.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Birds in flying defend their Neſts, and Young, by giering and veering in the Air as the <hi>Plover</hi> or <hi>Lapwing,</hi> that keeps a flutter (at a diſtance) to elude the danger. So God would lead the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> into a groſs miſtake by putting him in hope, of his now finding the Neſt of that People, <hi>Chap.</hi> 10.14. and none moved the Wing at him, yet it was vain hope. Or,</p>
            <pb n="92" facs="tcp:151110:56"/>
            <p n="3">3. As Birds of Prey, (the Eagle, and ſuch) do ſoar to a high Mount in the Air, yet have an Eye to their Neſt and Young, and finding them in danger, douſe down for their ſafety, on the backs of all that rob the Neſt, or ſeize on the Young: So the Lord (as an Eagle) would flutter o're <hi>Zion, Deut.</hi> 32.11. and ſave his Children; ſecure and watch the Meetings on <hi>Zion,</hi> and ſhortly douſe on the backs of the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> ſo he did three ways: as, 1. On the Army, that was ſlain. 2. The young Captains they fled. 3. The King he by his Succeſſors was kill'd; and all as <hi>Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah</hi> pray'd, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 19.15. <hi>O God, that dwelleſt among the Cherubims,</hi> &amp;c. that was God's Neſt, and thence God emitted fire from's Altar, that made 'em afraid, (as <hi>verſ.</hi> 9.) and at laſt that being the beſt City of all civil and ſacred Treaſure; God that was preſent among them would be their Defence, <hi>a Jehova Niſci,</hi> and (as once in <hi>Egypt</hi>) make a new Paſſover in (both) their reſcue from the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lons, (that <hi>vivitur ex rapto</hi>) and in a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge on him, for both theſe are in the ſenſe.</p>
            <p>Now hence may all the Monſters on Earth, the rampant Lions at Arms, the voracious Eagles of Prey take warning, that the Prayer ſtolen off God's Altar, hath a live Coal cleaving to't, (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 10.16.) that under all their Glory ſhall kindle a burning (as a Fire not blown, (<hi>Job</hi> 20.26.) which ſhortly will conſume the Forreſt of their Carmel, the Neſts of their

            <p n="3">3. God's Defence is like that of a Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd that that wards by day, and watches by night for the ſafety of his Flock: it's
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:151110:57"/>true, if God do fall on the Prey, a multitude of them will never ſtop his purſuit, by their fear or noiſe, to prevent his Prey, nor reſcue it (ſeiz'd) as <hi>Iſa.</hi> 31.4. Yet if God will defend his own, (Oh all ye Paſtors)! and ſave his Lambs in their Folds from your Paws, and Jaws, he'll not abaſe himſelf for your noiſe; ſo will the Lord fight for mount <hi>Zion,</hi> and the Hill thereof; ſo is the ſenſe <hi>(Annotat. in loc.)</hi> and conſonant to other Scriptures, as <hi>Mic.</hi> 5.7, 8. and ſo obſerve that of <hi>Ezek.</hi> 34.7, 8, 12, &amp;c. where the Lord complains of the falſe Paſtors, (of both ſorts) that rul'd with Force and Cruelty, to the ſcattering of God's Flock, and of the hard Meaſures and Paſtures given them, how they ate but fed not the Flock; whence Dr. <hi>Mayor</hi> (<hi>In loc. p.</hi> 451. <hi>A Lapid.</hi>) cites an old Canon, <hi>Beneficium da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur propter Officium; i.e.</hi> Proſit requires Duty, and ſo finds juſt fault with our Church-men that took of the Fall and did not the Duty; <q rend="inline">Lords, Biſhops, Deans, Deacons, Prebends, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Pluraliſts; but all their gain proves but as that <hi>Aurum Tholoſanum,</hi> to waſt their Wealth; againſt ſuch Harpies two things are promiſed.</q>

            <p n="4">4. Like a Wall: when the Church bewails her Miſery, 'tis expreſt by deſtroying the Wall of the Daughter of <hi>Zion, Lam.</hi> 8.2. which being broke or trod down, lays the Vineyard open to Boars and little Foxes: When that Church <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5.2, 5. is built up, its call'd a Wall, <hi>Cant.</hi> 8.9, 10. and the faithful Prophets are ſtil'd Brazen Walls, <hi>Jer.</hi> 15.20. Nor can this fenced Wall be skaill'd, (but by Sin) or hindred long in rearing, tho in troubleſome times, <hi>Dan.</hi> 2.25. No trouble in the times, may ſtay God's Workmen, nor ought, nor indeed can; for when our Walls are to be built, it's promiſs'd the Decree (<hi>Mic.</hi> 7.11.) ſhall be remov'd far; <hi>(i.e.)</hi> the Decree of God's Diſpleaſure, as <hi>Zep.</hi> 2.2. or the Decree of Man's prohibition, <hi>Ezra</hi> 4. 19, 21.</p>
            <p>Now a Wall, if ſtrong (as this is) being God's, receives all the Balls and Bullets, all Blaſts and Batterys, that are beat upon't, and cauſes them all to recoyl, ſometimes to the hurt of him that ſent'em; ever to the fafety

But I urge it to ſhow more publickly, the Defence that God's Camp is to his Houſe, more to his Bed; as <hi>Solomon</hi>'s guarded by the Swords (<hi>Cant.</hi> 3. 7, 8.) of ſixty valiant Men, (Bed <hi>(i.e.)</hi> of Communion with his;) becauſe of fear in the Night.

For as God is a Man of War, ſo in our Defence he uſes not only a Sword of Defence, but Arrows, that wound at a diſtance; and tho the way and time of God's Warfare is unknown, yet is he oft in the Field, for <hi>Zion</hi>'s cauſe, and Sons, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly draws a Bow, (or at adventure lets one do't) that ſends going the proudeſt <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hab;</hi> and if his Tools be but a Shepherd's Bag, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17.49. a Sling, or a ſmoonth Stone (of Prayer) as <hi>ver.</hi> 15. that, (as once

            <p>Hence God the Judg of all, comes alſo to the Bar, as witneſs or pleader for the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner (his Client) and runs in (as that word <hi>Interceſſor</hi> ſignifies) wondering that none would eſpouſe a forlorn Cauſe, that ſues to Men <hi>(in formâ pauperis)</hi> for Law and Right for God's ſake, due to the vileſt, tho denied, or delayed the beſt.

            <p n="7">7. By a Dream: Sometimes God pleads by ſome Terrour, or a Fright; thundering in the Conſcience, as with <hi>Abimelech,</hi> (<hi>Gen.</hi> 20.6.) for the Prophet <hi>Abraham,</hi> and cauſed him, ſend him away, (and <hi>Sarah</hi> too) in Peace and Wealth; ſo did ſome of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours, as <hi>Diocleſian,</hi> lay down the Robe and Scepter for a Retirement, being terrified with Thunder, and not able to rule longer.</p>
            <p>Now all theſe, and many more ways, God has to plead mildly with the Minds of Men, in whom Religion ſways not, to abate the Rigour of Perſecutions, againſt Piety and pure Worſhip, but he has (if need be) ſome ſharper and more ſevere judicial ways.</p>
            <p>As to inſtance: how did the Terrour of God ſting <hi>Cain</hi> for Murther of <hi>Abel</hi> in the cauſe of Worſhip? that he cries out, <hi>his Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment was greater than he could bear;</hi> Gen. 4.13. Deſpair, and an ill Conſcience (ſtain'd with Blood) are two ſwift Blood-hounds. <hi>Alphonſus Diazius,</hi> that ſlew his Brother <hi>John,</hi> and <hi>Ward</hi>'s Inſtance of that Jeſuit in <hi>Lancaſhire</hi> that leap'd over a Hedg into a Pit and was drown'd, to flee one that followed with his
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:151110:63"/>own Glove dropt: But ſays one, (<hi>Cambdens Eliz.</hi> 165.) <hi>R.</hi> 3. and Queen <hi>Ma</hi>— had the ſhorteſt Reigns of any, ſince the Conqueſt, and for that urges a threat, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 55.23.) bloody and deceitful Men, half not their days. For of <hi>Rich. 3d.</hi> (ſays <hi>Pol. Virg. &amp; Dan. Chron.</hi> p. 249.) After the Murder of his two In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent Nephews, fearful Dreams and Viſions dog'd him, that he would catch up his Sword, and hunt about his Room; alſo before <hi>Boſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth</hi> field, he had a Dream, that all the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils were hauling him in ugly Shapes; and what Friends they were to Religion, let the Chronicle of their Times ſhow. The Jews fancy <hi>Cain</hi>'s Head was horn'd; and if all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutors Heads were ſo, how many Men (as Devils) ſhould we meet on every Bench and Street? but it is enough if God hornett their Conſcience. <hi>Belſhazzar</hi> had a <hi>Mene Tekel</hi> ſet on's Wall, for carouſing idolatrouſly in the holy Veſſels: Oh what will become of thoſe that quaff up their [Damme's] in the Tears of the oppreſſed, if not in their Blood, and lie on the Pledges of every Altar, panting after the Prey of the poor and meek. (<hi>Amos</hi> 2.7, 8.)</p>
            <p>In a word, how was <hi>Pharaoh</hi> whipt with a laſh of ten Twiſts <hi>(i.e.)</hi> Judgments upon the Land, Fruits, Waters, Corn, Cattel; nay, Houſes and Bodies too, and (at laſt) lives of the firſt-born, comprized by one ſo:
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:151110:64"/>
               <q>
                  <l>Fit cruor ex undis, conſpurcant omnia ranae;</l>
                  <l>Dat pluvis cimices, poſtea muſca venit.</l>

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Which one puts in two Lines as thus.</p>
            <q>

               <l>Peſt, Boils, Hail, Locuſts, Dark, laſt, Firſt-born dies.</l>
            </q>
            <p>In all which a peculiar aptitude of the Plagues (moſt of them) may be obſerved to the Sin of <hi>Egypt,</hi> in letting God's Worſhip: As they deny to free <hi>Iſrael,</hi> God puniſhes them in their Wealth, they allow them not Sacrifice, God mars their Gardens, Cattel, that were their Gods. Again, do they detain God's firſt-born from his Service? the Lord plagues theirs; and yet diſtinguiſhes ſtill 'twixt <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Egypt,</hi> and at laſt brings them out by force, as with an high hand. That Land can never proſper, that will neither ſerve God themſelves aright, nor ſuffer others.</p>
            <p>But having largely, and often toucht this, and ſince 'tis our ſcope, may yet meet with it; I wave it here, and only collect hence that God has both ſorts of Pleas, thorowly to plead his Peoples cauſe, (<hi>Jer.</hi> 50.33, 34.)
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:151110:64"/>bring them out, and alſo to diſquiet the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of <hi>Babylon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet to compleat this, and ſhow the nature and manner of God's Defence of his Worſhip; let theſe Notes be further obſerved. As,</p>
            <p n="1">1. He does it wiſely; our ſelf-Defences in words or blows oft prove inadvertent, and not with good Counſel; God's for us is ever in Wiſdom. Going to <hi>Egypt</hi> for Defence, was a return to old Oppreſſors and Superſtitions, and ſo a ſign of Weakneſs and Folly; God to cure that, lets them ſee an Effort of his Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, in partly ſaving them from the wound, that leaning to that bruiſed Reed brought, as <hi>Ezek.</hi> 29.6, 7, 8. and partly in puniſhing the Staff and the Leaner, the Helper and the Holpen; letting both fall at once. Hence ſays the Prophet, <hi>He alſo is wiſe, to bring Evil on the Houſe of Evil-doers, and their Help;</hi> (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 31.2. <hi>Chap.</hi> 10.20.) when God ſtrips his of all falſe ſtays, its a wiſe Act, to ſtay us on him alone, and beat us out of our falſe Aids, and places of refuge. That <hi>Jaſper Coligni</hi> Admiral of <hi>France,</hi> bought his Royal Truſt too dear, in loſs of his Life, and thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands more. We need a wiſe Defender to ſteer us off theſe Shelves and Syrts.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He defends us willingly, freely, (not for Price or Reward) as he redeems us; 'tis ſo he plants his, <hi>with his whole Heart, and whole Soul,</hi> (<hi>Jer.</hi> 32.41.) Human, Civil, or Military Help may be got, but ſeldom is
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:151110:65"/>granted, ſave as the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> tending to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs; or as the Merchants Convoy oft at Sea, it's paid for more than it's worth. God's Houſe ſeldom is beholden to the free Auxili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aries of Men, unleſs with the pillage and pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of Sanctuary, and covert of the Sabbath. <hi>An hired Raſor ſhaves low and cloſe,</hi> (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 7.20.) but God's Defence is free, all the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, Creatures, Elements and Stars ſtand at his beck, and go at his Will, and take no Gain of Money, no Profit; are free Agents.</p>
            <p>As Nature needs no hire to ſuccour its own, ſo Grace deſpiſes Motives or force to ſtand up for his own adopted.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Seaſonably in the beſt time, perhaps that is ſometimes early (as its ſaid,) <hi>Before the Pots can feel the Thorns, he takes them away alive, and in his Wrath:</hi> (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 58.9. and 2. <hi>ult.</hi>) Some periſh in the mid-way, when Wrath is in a little kindled againſt them; and ſome are ſuddenly ſmit in the bud of their Pride, and the Juſt reſcued in one night, as the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> gave <hi>at evening-tide Trouble, but before the Morning he is not:</hi> as <hi>Iſa.</hi> 17.14. Again, God trowls with ſome in a long Line, lets 'em go as unruly Whales, or wild Aſſes, till in their occaſion he finds them (<hi>Jer.</hi> 2.25.) And ſo he did with <hi>Nero,</hi> who after all his dedicating of Chriſtian Blood in Martyrdom;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Emper. Hiſt.</hi> —<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ltor a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go Deus.</note> at laſt it o'retook him, in a ſeries of black Tidings. 1. An Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:151110:65"/>ruin'd many Cities, as <hi>Laodicea,</hi> &amp;c. Next <hi>Britain</hi> (oh early Rebellion) Revolts from the Roman Yoke; <hi>Armenia</hi>'s loſt by cowardiſe. After an ignoble Peace is made with <hi>Parthia;</hi> next <hi>Rome</hi> is (by his means) burnt while he ſings to't, <hi>Homer</hi>'s Verſes of old <hi>Troy</hi> fired, to his ſhame; after fell one of the greateſt Plagues ever was, juſt upon the Perſecution of the Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>Then <hi>Piſo</hi>'s Conſpiracy is found and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, and next to that <hi>Vindex,</hi> after the Jews rebel alſo; then the Provinces of <hi>France</hi> revolt, and the Legions do chuſe <hi>Tul. Vindex</hi> Captain: next, part of <hi>Spain;</hi> this ſtunn'd him, and nigh madded his Brain: yet more of the ſame News comes, of the upper <hi>Germany:</hi> next the Senate <hi>(mero motu)</hi> abandon him; then to his Box of Poyſon, but none durſt adminiſter it; then to his Flight, or Tuck, but is afraid to uſe it,<note place="margin">A ſeries of <hi>Nero</hi>'s <hi>11</hi> or <hi>12</hi> Ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rums ere he dies.</note> and ſaid (as <hi>C. Tacit.</hi> writes) Now <hi>Nero</hi> has nor Friend nor Foe; he that at firſt was ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, at laſt ſo feared; now was neither; So that at laſt, by the Senates vote, being told that he ſhould die <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re majorum,</hi> and hearing the Horſe at hand, he made a ſhift by help of a Servant to cut his own Throat. And ſo died that <hi>hoſtis humani generis,</hi> the Enemy of Mankind, and the Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Earth. So ſeaſonably God defends his Servant <hi>Paul,</hi> by a ſudden after Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:151110:66"/>of that holy Apoſtle, and many elſe beheaded, and martyr'd by him.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Secretly, in a ſtrange hidden way, by means not foreſeen, nor expected; and ſo no way to be prevented: a hand is under the Wing, and within the wheel, that ſaves, defends, or revenges: <hi>Habakkuk,</hi> ſpeaking of Horns out of his Hand, adds, <hi>there was the hiding of God's Power:</hi> Hab. 3.4. <hi>(i. e.)</hi> by a Horn of Safety, and a ſecret hand of Power, (hid Arrows of Peſtilence) he ſaved us, and puniſh'd <hi>Egypt;</hi> and led us along the Deſert; we ſee the Effect, but who ſpys the Cauſe? ſo that (with <hi>Moſes</hi>) we may turn aſide to ſee the buſh.</p>
            <p n="5">5. His Defence is general, univerſal, at all times, in all Ages, of all ſorts, and Perſons, (ſoon or late) he fails not to fulfil his Promiſe to <hi>Abraham;</hi> Gen. 17.1. <hi>I am thy Shield, and thy exceeding great Reward, (i.e.)</hi> Be thou upright, and walk with me, and I will be a Shield to thee, and thy Children, in all Ages, and times coming, to all of thy Faith and Stock, as well Jew as Gentile: my Worſhippers ſhall univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally be kept, impartially ſhadow'd and ſaved. Tho all have not the ſame meaſure of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, yet all the Heirs of Promiſe, (the Sons of the ſame Father) ſhall be under the ſame Wing of Protection, all the day.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Valiantly, for he has valiant Men to ran-counter, robuſt and reſolute ones, that hector with him, and his Altar, Name, Glory,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:151110:66"/>Houſe, as if nothing; ſcorn his Service, Laws, and Worſhipers, call it Idleneſs, and ſay, as he, <hi>Exod.</hi> 5.2. <hi>Who is the Lord? I know him not,</hi> &amp;c. Then he loves to be ſtiled a Man of War, valiant in fight: <hi>But had not the Lord been on our ſide, Pſal.</hi> 124.2. (ay! that's our Shield) <hi>they had ſwallow'd us up quick,</hi> &amp;c. He's a Captain that commands any Army, in Heaven or Earth; as was ſaid of <hi>Antigonus</hi> when a Souldier ſaid how ſupernumerous the Enemy was; Oh, but how many do you reckon me for? he gives (ſays Mr. <hi>S.R.</hi>) all Princes Councels and Armies to one party; and to the other, only that wooden Dagger, the Croſs, and yet this ſhall prevail by the Blood of the Lamb; <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.11. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.15. <hi>Apoc.</hi> 12.11. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 14.6. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.33.) and ſo did our Lord, and ſo did <hi>Sampſon, David, Jonathan,</hi> wax valiant in fight, put to flight the Armies of Aliens, and oft with the ſmalleſt Tools, feweſt numbers, and weakeſt Men, yea oft by Women and Children (as the <hi>Waldenſes</hi>) God has defended his Houſe and Servants, (all elſe failing) they only crying, Lord, help us; (Sir <hi>Sam. Morland.</hi>) And of all, the ſole reaſon is, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 60. <hi>ult.</hi> for he it is, that treads under our Enemies. God, and nothing elſe, is as much (if not more) as God and all things, for all that is in any, or all helps inferiour, and created, is originate, and derives from him, who is all; and the leſs the Arm of Fleſh is ſeen in any Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:151110:67"/>the more does God make bare his.</p>
            <p n="7">7. And laſtly; He defends wondrouſly, no leſs than a Miracle is put out, in ſome Defences. So I'm recall'd to our Text in <hi>Sam.</hi> as he is ſacrificing, the Lord is thundering from Heaven on the <hi>Philiſtines.</hi> God's Canons, and the Ordinances of Heaven (as call'd, <hi>Job</hi> 38.33.) ſtill do the beſt Execution, and were thouſands of Years afore any of ours; and theſe are but Pot-guns to the other; build a Tower, as that of <hi>Babel,</hi> dig (oh ye Plotters) as deep for its Foundation as <hi>Sheol,</hi> (Hell) make the Walls as ſtrong as Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond; let the heighth of it equal the Clouds, its Breath the four Winds, lay its Platform of <hi>Cedar,</hi> plant it with Guns like the Duke of <hi>Ferara</hi>'s, or the <hi>Turks</hi> Magazine, Man it, and moat it with the broad Sea, fortify it with conſecrated Guns, Spells and Excor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſms, and after all, let God look down, ſpeak a word <hi>[Go to]</hi> or blow, all's ruin'd; but if he do (as here he did) <hi>Thunder a while, who underſtands the Power of it? Job</hi> 26.14. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.91. 'tis the Voice of God (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 29.3.) which Man ſhould (and will not) under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, and ſo is made to feel it. Trace the Stories of old Scripture-times, and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feats given in Battels by the heavenly Hoſts for <hi>Iſrael;</hi> and ſee if our Defence be not both mirandous and miraculous, tho Man gave not a Blow: the firſt uſe God made of this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence for his Service, and People were in
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:151110:67"/>
               <hi>Egypt,</hi> the ſeventh Plague of Hail comes attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thus; (<hi>Exod.</hi> 9.28.) or (as the Hebrews calls it here) Voices of God, to ſhow God did not whiſper now, but ſpoke aloud in this mixt Judgment of Fire, and Hail, hot and cold, Lightning terrible to the Eye, Thunder to the Ear. Two things it ſpake: 1. The defeat of Sorcery, theſe Signs could not the Magical Arts do: <hi>Moſes</hi> of old, (as <hi>Tindal,</hi> (<hi>Acts Mon.</hi> f. 985.) of late, Martyr) ſtops all the Arts of the Gypſy-jugglers, as they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt; one Martyr's too hard for twenty Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicians. 2. The diviſion (or as it's read <hi>[Redemption]</hi> that God put (more than once, <hi>Exod.</hi> 8.23. <hi>Chap.</hi> 9.26.) 'twixt <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Egypt,</hi> made this Defence a more obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and obſervable Wonder; nd to be in <hi>Egypt,</hi> that had, <hi>[nè ſtilla quidem aquae,]</hi> (<hi>as</hi> Dio <hi>reports</hi>) been never us'd to rain. <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi> is convinc'd (ſo is an Atheiſt) to ſee <hi>Aetna</hi>'s Floods of Fire part in a Lane, to paſs them that religiouſly did ſave their old Parents, when the Houſes adjacent were burnt: (<hi>Exod.</hi> 8.22.) thus God marvelouſly did ſeparate them from <hi>Egypt.</hi> But to go on with the Hiſtory of Thunder for Saints Safety.</p>
            <p n="2">2d. Time was at Promulgation of the Laws for Worſhip, to awe them with the dread of God; and ſhall Goſpel Purity be ſlighted of us?</p>
            <pb n="116" facs="tcp:151110:68"/>
            <p n="3">3. A third was at <hi>Joſhua</hi>'s defeat of the <hi>Canaanites;</hi> here Hail-ſtones fall on them (as <hi>Joſhua</hi> prayed) <hi>Joſh.</hi> 10.11. and he diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits them in a purſuit of ſome 18 Miles at <hi>Gibeon;</hi> hereto the Prophet alludes in that ſtrange Work, and wonderful Act, once done in the Valley of <hi>Gibeon</hi> (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 28.21.) to be repeated when that Conſumption decreed is on the Earth: At this Faith one wonders; <hi>O Fidem mirabilem — &amp; Orationis vim, quae Victoriae trophaea in Coeli orbibus figit!</hi> O admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Faith and force of Prayer, that fixes the Trophies of its Conqueſt in the heavenly Orbs!</p>
            <p>Nor is it likely that ſtrange Storm fell with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Noiſe, or Thunder-claps, <hi>(Joſephus)</hi> bringing ſuch Stones and Bolts, for the word [for diſcomfited] as one notes (<hi>Dr.</hi> Mayor <hi>in loc. a day of</hi> 18 <hi>Hours</hi> has a Signification of Terrour.) However it muſt be ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, to brain the purſued, and not hurt <hi>Joſhua</hi> (or <hi>Iſrael</hi> at the back) purſuing, all for that Covenant made before (tho inad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertently) with <hi>Gibeon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. The fourth thundering defeat fell on the ſame <hi>Canaanites</hi> (not long after) in the day of the Judges, (<hi>Judg.</hi> 4.15. <hi>cum</hi> 5.20.) where the Stars are ſaid to fight in their Courſes <hi>(i.e.)</hi> ſay ſome by Comets, or Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teors; others <hi>(as Hugo.

<pb n="117" facs="tcp:151110:68"/>defeating <hi>Jabin.</hi> (Two ſorts of Forces (they ſay) God has: 1. Is his <hi>Magaleh Cheloth.</hi> 2. His <hi>Matteh Cheloth (i.e.)</hi> upper Forces, and lower Armies; and wo to that King or Land, that is fought by 'em both.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The fifth is in <hi>Hannah</hi>'s Propheſy, and actually is fulfill'd (ſome days after) on the <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> (by her Son, Prophet, Prieſt and Judg then) 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.10. <hi>Chap.</hi> 7.10. who, as he's offering the ſuckling to God, to verify her Faith thunders on them, ſo they're defeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed too, and retire like Worms.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The ſixth was in <hi>Saul</hi>'s days, towards <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel</hi>'s end; to reprove their over haſty proter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Affection to a King, (al-a-mode) to be like the Nations; in rejection of God, and his Judges, that had ſaved them ſo long, (1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.17, 18, <hi>ult.</hi>) which convinc'd them, tho after they ſmarted dearly for't. (But this is beſides our purpoſe.)</p>
            <p n="7">7. The ſeventh fell out in <hi>David</hi>'s time, whoſe Liberty, Life, Worſhip and all was in hazard by <hi>Saul:</hi> (2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 22.8, 9, 11, 14.) that occaſion'd his Diſtreſs, that Curſe, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 26.19. and many a Cry to God: and what got he by it? Why, Earthquake, Clouds, Fire, Thunder: God ſpake by't, and ſcatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Enemies. Note hence, that when Men are purſued (as <hi>David</hi>) for Integrity, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring after God's Will (as he did at <hi>Nob</hi>) and no Appeals or Addreſſes obtain; they are call'd to put up the louder Cries to God, and
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:151110:69"/>then may hope God will rather do Wonders, <hi>and anſwer them by terrible things, or in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret place of Thunder:</hi> (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 81.7. &amp; 65.5. <hi>Rev.</hi> 8.5.) Then let their Enemies prevail. But obſerve further, whence he got an Ear; <hi>verſ.</hi> 6. out of his Temple, that was the Sanctuary he fled to, his laſt <hi>Anchora ſacra,</hi> (tho yet no Temple was) and thence he got help; and the end of all was (as <hi>Moſes</hi>) to draw him out of many Waters; <hi>ver.</hi> 16.</p>
            <p n="8">8. One more fulminating Effort of Venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance is reported on the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi>-ſiege of City and Sanctuary; <hi>Iſa.</hi> 29.6. <hi>Thou ſhalt be viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of the Lord of Hoſts, with Thunder, Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake, Flame, and Tempeſt,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>(i.e.)</hi> God will defend his Altar from <hi>Aſher</hi> by his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, cauſing a Blaſt, Tempeſt, Clouds, and all Elements, to joyn Battel, and ſalley out on the Beſiegers, and ſo ſend them home with a vengeance. By all theſe it's plain, God did miraculouſly defend his Altar of Old; and New Teſtament is not without ſome Inſtances of Thunder, in witneſs to his Name and Service.</p>
            <p>One is, that glorious Voice anſwering Chriſt's Prayer in <hi>John</hi> (<hi>Joh.</hi> 12.28, 29.) a little ere Chriſt's Paſſion, when God gave ſo loud an Inſtance of his Love and Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to Chriſt, regard to his own Name, and the Evincement of our Lord's Miſſion, and ſo loud and audible, that it's call'd Thunder, or an Angel that ſpake.

            <p>Nor is the laſt Propheſy void of Evidence to ſo great a Truth; for the Goſpel-times have found greateſt Oppoſition to its Truths and Worſhip; ſo that Prudence has not (in a ſucceſſive way) been wanting thus to exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plify the Promiſe, (<hi>Apoc.</hi> 4.5. &amp; 6.1. &amp; 5.8. &amp; 11.19 &amp; 14.2. &amp; 19.6.) ſix times in the <hi>Revelations</hi> is Thunder foretold; all which is not yet totally fulfill'd: and tho Thunder in that Propheſy may intend a myſtical, or me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphorical Expreſſion of God's terrible Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, yet Experience in after-Ages ſhows it was verified in the letter alſo: As <hi>Fr.

            <p>In <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi>'s days (<hi>Anno</hi> (181.) a Battel was fought with the <hi>Quads</hi> and Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern Nations, and (at laſt) Victory gain'd at the Prayers of Chriſtians, deſired by him, thus recorded; (<hi>Dio in vitâ</hi> M.

So the <hi>Romans</hi> by Prayer
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:151110:70" rendition="simple:additions"/>were both fed, and ſav'd: What a two-edg'd Sword is Prayer? and hence it was (as after we may read) that the Emperour to the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate wrote for the Chriſtians Liberty.</p>
            <p>The like is recorded of two brave <hi>Romans,</hi> [<hi>duo fulmina Belli,</hi> as the Poet <hi>Lucan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory tells us of <hi>Theodoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> againſt <hi>Eugenius,</hi> (<hi>Euſeb.</hi> p. 261.) that thus pray'd; <hi>Tu noſti Omnipotens,</hi> &amp;c. Lord thou knoweſt that in Chriſt's Name I took up this War, in revenging thee of thine Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; if not revenge, it on me: ſo reach out thy hand, leſt they ſay, where is your God? on which they fell to the Slaughter. <hi>Agmina Hoſtium perrumpunt,</hi> kill'd heaps of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; incredible 'tis, that after that Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, <hi>Ventus ita vehemens exortus eſt, ut tela ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtium retorqueret:</hi> ſo vehement a Wind roſe, that it repell'd the Darts of the Enemies back on themſelves; they from Heaven <hi>(Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinitus repulſis)</hi> being beat and defeated, <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genius</hi> is took, ſo ends his Life and Fight.</p>
            <p>Other Examples of this, with other kinds of Judgments in a miraculous way, might be given, to ſhow the miraculous Defence that God has made for the Lovers of his Name; but being ſo large in this, I will not further add. So this ſuffices to ſhow the way and manner of God's wiſe and wonderful De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of his Worſhippers, and therein of his Truth, Name, and Cauſe; the Reaſons briefly are as follow.</p>
            <pb n="121" facs="tcp:151110:70"/>
            <p>Now that it is ſo, and how, is plain; why ſo, is the thing next to be proved by five Arguments.</p>
            <p n="1">1. From the glorious Diſpenſation of the Law, which tho in Glory inferiour to the Goſpel, yet had its Defence then; from that I argue, from the leſs to the greater: It was then ſo, it muſt be now (much more); God is the ſame, changes not in care and defence of his own Appointments: of Matter or Forms ſome Change (<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.12. &amp; 12.27.) may be <hi>(Rei non Dei mutatio)</hi> not of God's nature; and that Change he makes is ever for better, to a greater Glory (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.9, 10.) but in his Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, Attributes, moral Precepts, Promiſes, Protection of his People, he's immutable, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.6. and hence are we not conſumed, and yet live, as a burning Buſh not ſpent, after thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of Years in Men's Furnace; ſee the wonder, and this is the reaſon, form it briefly ſo: If the legal and leſs glorious Diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on had a typical Defence, ſo (much more) has the Evangelical in the truth of it; but true is the former, ſo then is the latter. The Aſſumption is argued from Experience of all Ages; the Conſequence bears on God's Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeableneſs. The Propoſition I prove by the Types of the Law, which was to them Goſpel vail'd, as it is to us now revealed. For after the Church grew from Domeſtick to National, and God had adopted <hi>Iſrael</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and by's Arm brought them out, <hi>to
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:151110:71"/>dwell alone,</hi> (<hi>Num.</hi> 23.9.) under his Wing, and had delivered Laws of three ſorts to them: 1. Moral, in ten words, perpetually to rule Life. 2. Judicial, to order the State. 3. Ceremonial, to direct (in Worſhip) that Church while it was National, he did in each (eſpecially the laſt ſort) put certain Rites and Forms (of his own Will) upon the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Tent, and after on the fixt Temple, by which this Truth was typed out, and reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled. I inſtance in that over the Tent, a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Type of our Safety now, during our long wandring (with the Woman) in the Wilderneſs, yet under God's Care and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, (mixt with much Darkneſs) to which <hi>Iſa.</hi> 4, 5, 6. (and other places) allude. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in the Doors of the Temple, after to be of Braſs, ſo ſtrong and maſſy that twenty four Men could but open them: and again, in thoſe Cherubs and Palms on the Door, Curtains, and Vails; and alſo in the two Cherubims with Wings over the Ark, and Mercy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeat, Types of God's Protection by Angels, over all true Miniſtry, and holy Myſteries of the Goſpel: But I confine the Proof to that of the Horns of the Altars, both that of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe at the Vail, that of Braſs for the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and that <hi>Ezek.</hi> 43.15. all had their Horns, and (about them) a Crown (ſo had the Shew-bread-Table) denoting in all the divine Authority put on God's Service, that none ought to corrupt, invade or infringe; and
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:151110:71"/>for that of four Horns, it ſignified that from all four Winds, God would have Reverence done to his Name; <hi>Mal.</hi> 1.11.</p>
            <p>But the placing of Horns on the four Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the Altar ſeems to note its four-fold uſe, as Authors conjecture. <hi>Dr.</hi> A. Willet <hi>in Exod.</hi> p. 616.</p>
            <p n="1">1. For putting the Blood of Atonement on its Horns; as <hi>Exod.</hi> 30.10. to note the Power and Efficacy of Chriſt's Plea for us.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To bind the Sacrifice thereto with Cords, that ſuppoſed a Reluctancy, (which was took inauſpicious) of which in that <hi>Pſalm</hi> 118.27.</p>
            <p n="3">3. To be a Sanctuary to flee to, for the guilty, as ſome Paſſages note (ſee <hi>Exod.</hi> 11.14.) ſo did <hi>Joab</hi> flee for ſhelter, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 2.28. to denote the need of Expiation, when by Conſcience of Sin, Satan purſues us.</p>
            <p n="4">4. (Moſt to our uſe). To ſhow God's Power in defence of his Suppliants, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to compaſs (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 26.6.) with penitent Hearts, and powerful hands of Faith; the two laſt ends are pertinent here, (the reſt teaching). This fourth is proper to our end, to ſhow God's Altar under the Law had (by his order) in it ſelf, a ſafe defenſive Property, or a ſtrange (but ſecret) ſelf-revenge, and can puſh for its Attendants, at all Aſſailers; and its Sparks can burn the Neſts of thoſe that (Eagle like) ſacrilegiouſly ſpoil the gift, or ſteal from it what is Gods due; and tho all the four Winds, (<hi>Mic.</hi> 5.5. <hi>Zech.</hi> 1. <hi>ult.</hi>) oft give it diſtreſs;
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:151110:72"/>the four Horns make its Defence; or four Carpenters, (ſeven Paſtors, eight principal Men) do fray them away. (<hi>Zech.</hi> 9.13, 15.) Nay, let the Sacrifice be conſumed to Aſhes, and fall under the Altar; (<hi>Rev.</hi> 6.9.) yet as ſacred Urns, the Souls under it cry, howling, and reſt not, till revenge is granted, which will ſurely come at laſt: It's alſo worth our note, That in two places of the Prophets, the Title given to the Altar, is the Lyon of God; in the one, the Hill of God; (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 29.1. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 43.15.) what bolder (ſtronger) than a Lion, higher than the Hill (of <hi>Zion</hi>) for ſecurity? Thus the Types lay the firſt ground.</p>
            <p>A ſecond ground bears on the Properties of God, together with the Promiſes made for it: the firſt ſhows his proweſs for its ſafety: the ſecond, his propenſeneſs to it: his Nature and Attributes incline him, his Promiſe obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges him; ſo both (leaving the time and way to his Wiſdom) are (to our Faith) confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by his Veracity. Divine Properties har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monize with themſelves: Juſtice and Goodneſs, tho (to us) they ſeem, <hi>diverſa</hi> in their Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, they be not <hi>oppoſita,</hi> they end <hi>in eodem tertio (i. e.)</hi> conclude in the good of his own. As all Lines meet in the Center; ſo all acts of Juſtice, Wrath, Revenge on the evil, (on the one part) and all the Efforts and Emanations of Mercy, Grace, Kindneſs (on the other part) to his, amount to this, and
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:151110:72"/>end in this point, that what God is, or does, is for his Elect: that which partakes of his own Nature, muſt needs be under his care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Eye, and Protection. His Worſhip is ſtiled by his Name, (<hi>Exod.</hi> 20.24.) ſo are his People, and both are called (<hi>Dan.</hi> 12.7.) Holy; and ſhall not the holy God defend them both? ſo is his Word holy, (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 5.24.) and will he not magnify it? (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 138.2, 3.) yea above all his Name: ſo was that glorious (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 64.11.) and beautiful Houſe ſtiled Holy: all the Appurtenances of divine Worſhip borrowed the ſtile Holy of him; and ſhall not that import divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection? what Abſurdities follow, were not this true, ſee Mr. <hi>St. Charnock</hi> of God's Power, (<hi>Char.</hi> p. 477, 478.) all things would fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a deplorable <hi>Chaos.</hi> 
               <q rend="inline">This is ground for our Worſhippers: We admire Princes for their Power, in ſubduing Foes and preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving their Peoples Peace; how may we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence God, that rules ſo vaſt Empires by a word or beck? we ſenſe the Thunder and Storms, and ſome Men as if they were God's what Reverence is due to infinite Power and Wiſdom, joyntly? — All Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion bears on two Pillars, Power and Goodneſs: without that, no benefit by it; without this, no Entertainment could be. Jews ſay <hi>Melech Hagnolam,</hi> hundreds of times, in their Prayers; what Faith of ſucceſs could we have, if Power and Mercy
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:151110:73"/>could not retain us?</q> A little after he notes, (<hi>pag.</hi> 484.) God is by one truly repreſented as a <hi>Jaſper,</hi> (<hi>Rev.</hi> 4.3.) on his Throne, a Stone withſtanding the greateſt Force; ſo is his Throne deſcribed by a fiery Throne, (<hi>Dan.</hi> 7.9.) for what Stubble will ſtand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it? ſo he.</p>
            <p>And for Promiſes, how many has he made, how free, rich, full, apt to all our Diſtreſſes, for his Altar ſake! by Grace he firſt made, and by Power will ſurely fulfil them to a tittle. When all was loſt (but <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi>) to <hi>Senacherib,</hi> ſee what a Promiſe is given (what a Royal Word) <hi>I will defend this City for my own ſake, and my Servant</hi> David: <hi>Iſa.</hi> 37.35. Two ſweet grounds for Faith! (Oh had <hi>London</hi> this good hold!) ſays he, I'm con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in my Glory and Houſe; for my Name is invocated there; and I will not let this black-mouth'd Rayler win it; to falſify my Promiſe, and verify his prophane Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: Nor is my Servant <hi>David</hi> a little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, that firſt conquered this Mount <hi>Zion,</hi> and brought my Ark to't, who had the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of a Lamp (1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8.37. &amp; 9.3. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 132.17.) to be here; and his Son built this Houſe to my name; <hi>Therefore I will defend the City too,</hi> (tho they are unworthy) <hi>for my own ſake:</hi> 2 Kings 19.34. Oh happy is that City, that God covers as with a Shield, (as the Hebrew is.) Of the City of God it may be ſaid, <hi>nec fluctu, nec flatu movetur:</hi> as <hi>Venice;</hi>
               <pb n="127" facs="tcp:151110:73"/>(Nor Winds nor Wave it moved have:) Or as <hi>Geneva,</hi> when inviron'd with Foes, and barr'd in from all help of Friends; it had been undone, but that it had ſo many Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; (rather) ſo good and ſtrong a God to defend it, as one (of this laſt Clauſe) notes; <hi>Haec Verba, divinitus prolata ſunt,</hi> as <hi>A Lapid.</hi> notes). Theſe words are as 'twere ſpoke from Heaven, to ſhow that God minds the Name and Stock of all Kings that promote the Settlement of his Ark, Preſence and Service in a City; and ſurely forgets not thoſe that ſeek to extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate them all: For now was <hi>Rabſhake,</hi> (and his Maſter) near the top and fall, (2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 32.15.) loring the true God to, nay below thoſe ſtump Deities, by him conquer'd. What Mouth could open wider, or bark lou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der? But to end this with <hi>Ezra</hi>'s Note and Text; (<hi>ſaid to the King</hi>) Ezr. 8.22. <hi>The hand of our God is on all them for good, that ſeek him; but his Power and his Wrath is againſt all them that forſake him:</hi> and that Faſt very much availed in Faith.</p>
            <p>A third ground of this Defence, riſes from the Power of the Adverſary, that God ſuffers oft to ſwell high, and climb up to <hi>Lucifer</hi>'s Orb. The greateſt Mercies and Deliverances riſe out of the loweſt Ebbs of his Cauſe and Lovers; and on the other hand, the heavieſt Wrath, and hotteſt Vengeance is neareſt the wicked, when Sin is fulleſt, and they at the heighth.</p>

            <p>In that Babyloniſh Boaſt of <hi>Lucifer,</hi> many are the Expreſſions uſed by the Spirit of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſy, to ſhow what a Mount the King of <hi>Babel</hi> took in the letter, and to predict the ranting Arrogancy (in the Spirit) Antichriſt would reach and ſwell to, in latter times, and againſt what, and how far, it would go. For, 1. <hi>In his Heart</hi> (ſays he, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 14.13, 14.) <hi>I'll aſcend to Heaven:</hi> 2. <hi>I'll exalt my Throne above the Stars of God,</hi> (i.e.) Chriſt's Miniſters: <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. <hi>ult.</hi> 3. <hi>And ſit on the Mount of the Congregation:</hi> (ſcatter all the Aſſemblies): <hi>And,</hi> 4. <hi>In the ſides of the North, where the great King's Throne and Place was;</hi> Pſal. 48.2. on <hi>Moriah:</hi> 5. (Ver. 14.) <hi>Above the heights of the Clouds,</hi> (Iſa. 5.6.) to ſtop the Doctrine of the Word from dropping. 6. <hi>I will be as the Moſt High,</hi> (Dan. 7.25.) that is, aſſume his Legiſlative Power o're the Conſcience, and Scripture; (in ſhort) <hi>I'll be called a God;</hi> 2 Theſ. 2.4. <hi>Tu merito in Terris diceris eſſe Deus;</hi>
               <pb n="129" facs="tcp:151110:74"/>as one flattered the Pope moſt blaſpemouſly, as worthy to be call'd a God.</p>
            <p>Nor are the degree (expreſt) of his Fall, leſs noted or notorious, in this Context ſix or ſeven of them are ſoon told (<hi>ver.</hi> 10, to 19.) juſt as <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> whoſe Will and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours one reckons to ſix too, (<hi>Bur. Exod.</hi> 15.9.) But (on the whole) it's obſervable, that Height and Obduracy is an evident mark of an inſtant fall from an high Hill, to a low and hot Hell; from a God, to a Devil; from a Star, to the ſide of a ſlimy Pit; from a Seat above the Clouds, and over all Law, Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and Worſhip, to a Grave, a <hi>Sheol,</hi> a dark deep Abiſs; from the noiſe of Pipes and Viols, (as <hi>David, Amos</hi> 6.5.) royal, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrated Bells and Organs, to roar among the infernal Covents of Confuſion; and how can it but be deem'd a doleſome Change? yet ſuch (ineffably) is the woful Perdition of all wilful Provocation; and ſo it befalls them that run on the boſſes of God's Buckler; <hi>Job</hi> 15.26.</p>
            <p>Now can higher Arrogancy be in Man, than to advance to the place and Seat of God? or greater Blaſphemy, than that <hi>againſt his Name, Tabernacle, and them that dwell in Heaven?</hi> (Rev. 13.6.) What more injurious Robbery, than to ſpoil the Altar of its Gifts, and God of his Glory? what groſſer Idolatry, than to reverence (or obey) <hi>a Creature above the
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:151110:75"/>Creator?</hi> (Rom. 1.25.) What higher Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanation of God's Sabbath, than to prohibit the ſanctifying thereof, and yet mock God with Calendar Saints days? What plainer Hypocriſy, than to deck a falſe, and curſe a true Church, (or Saint)? to paint the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulcher (<hi>Mat.</hi> 23.9.) perſecute the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr'd Prophet? Kiſs the Calf, and kick at the Law? <hi>High time for God to work, when that is void:</hi> Pſal. 119.126.</p>
            <p n="4">4. This Defence is grounded on the ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Complaints and ſolemn Appeals (all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long) made in ſuffering-times by the Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, to the Juſt and Sin-revenging God, to whom Vengeance belongs; and as he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives them graciouſly, ſo he revenges them certainly, and often ſpeedily, making amends for the long delay by the Severity of the Blow; and if Law-wrath (for Wrongs to Man) be due, and every Tranſgreſſion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceceived a due Recompence by <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Law; what is due for Injuries to Chriſt and his Goſpel! As the Apoſtle argues, (<hi>Heb.</hi> 6.6, 7. and 10.28, 29. &amp; 12.25.) of how much ſeverer (or ſorer) Puniſhment is he thought worthy, that refuſes him that ſpake (nay forbids it) from Heaven, and tramples under foot that Covenant-Blood, that ſhould ſprinkle the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and deſpites the Spirit, in the Exerciſes of its Gifts and Graces?</p>
            <pb n="131" facs="tcp:151110:75"/>
            <p>Now of theſe Complaints, the Scripture in all Ages, is both full, and in frequent uſe; when the Prieſts Wife was in Travel, the pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſenſe of her Fathers death, or his two Sons (her Husband one of them) or yet of the triumph of the uncircumciſed <hi>Philiſtine,</hi> or of the ſlain <hi>(i.e.)</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 4.10.) 30 thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, or the loſs of the maintenance of her Life, did not all affect her (though in her pains) ſo as the <hi>Ark</hi> and the Glory did: now is ſhe concerned, and names here Son <hi>I-chabod, v.</hi> 19.22. (<hi>where</hi>'s <hi>the Glory?</hi>) ſo with that expires. But to the queſtion, <hi>ſtaid not</hi> (for grief) to get Anſwer; alas that was gone captive! ſhe only lived to repeat that twice.</p>
            <p>In ſeveral Paſſages of the <hi>Pſalms</hi> the like ſad Complaints occurr, as any may read that will, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 44.9-16-20. and 42.4, 10. And how they were broke in the Place of Dragons; tho yet they had not forgot God's Name, but did cleave truly to his Covenant, a Complaint very dolorous: like to it is that of <hi>David</hi>'s flight, uttered, <hi>For the ſcattered multitude I had gone,</hi> (q.d.) <hi>now I can't, that is my Loſs, my Grief,</hi> v. 10. And the effect was ſad on his Spirit: for how dejected muſt he needs be, and what diſquiet muſt it bring to one wont to, and chear'd by a Preſence, to hear men (that prize not a Preſence) rejoyce ore him that did, tauntingly to ſay, <hi>Where is thy God?</hi> A Sword a drawing, or at the Breaſt, or cutting the Fleſh, is painful; but this is a Sword in the
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:151110:76"/>Bones, digs in the Marrow, or within the Ribs, at the Vitals; ſo it ſtruck at heart and life, to hear the Queſtion, Where? and not be able to anſwer to it (as they did) <hi>Lo this (or here) is our God,</hi> Iſai. 25.9.</p>
            <p>So in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 43.3, 4. What his Plant was, and how great, may be ſeen in the Cure pray'd for; <hi>That by Gods Light and Truth he might be led back to the Holy Hill, to God's Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacles, and go to the Altar of God, his exceeding Joy; now all his Plaints would ceaſe in a Song.</hi>

            <p>In another, he bemoans himſelf; <hi>as in a dry Deſert,</hi> (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 63.1, 2.) <hi>where no water was, ſeeking, longing, thirſting, following hard, to ſee that Beauty and Glory as once in the Sanctuary.</hi> The want of Sanctuary and Altar-approaches, is heavy, and no quieting a Child of God, without thoſe Teats and Breaſts of Conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>Many the like, (ſee in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 74.1, 2, <hi>&amp; per totum</hi>) the Congregation in <hi>Zion,</hi> Oh that was loſt, and the fore-view of its deſolations called perpetual, to ſee what the Enemy had done in the Sanctuary, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> what roaring, fire, reproaches, and tumults, in God's Aſſemblies they had perpetrated.</p>

Tho the Place was pleaſant, it could not ſtop tears,<note place="margin">Pareus Adv. <hi>p. 396.</hi> calls it Riſus Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinius Impius: <hi>(i.e.)</hi> of an Herb, that (bit on) kills one laughing.

            <p>One Complaint more (to wave the <hi>Lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi>) ſee in the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 63.18. and 64.10.11.) that almoſt 200 years afore, laments by a Spirit of Propheſy, the Miſeries of that People, when the Sanctuary lies deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late <hi>(they have trodden down the Lords Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary)</hi> laid <hi>Zion</hi> and the <hi>Temple</hi> waſte, where the Fathers praiſed him.</p>
            <pb n="134" facs="tcp:151110:77"/>
            <p>Now tho theſe Complains were verified on the <hi>Temple</hi> by the <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> and once more by the <hi>Romans;</hi> and <hi>Pompey</hi> trod in the Holy Place (not without ſore terrour to him) yet it extends to any times of After-violences, on the Goſpel-Worſhippers: and in the next Chapter (<hi>v.</hi> 1.) it had an Anſwer.</p>
            <p>But (on the whole, to ſumme up this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) what ſignifies Complaint, if wholly fruitleſs? or why made to God, if he forget them, or never means to afford Relief to them? Why is he ſtiled <hi>Elſhaddai, El-elohim, Jehovah Niſſi, Jehovah Jireh</hi> (and the like) but to ſignifie his Power to help, and Will to hear? are any empty, Titles attributed to him (as airy ones are oft unto men) <hi>Job</hi> ſays, <hi>Job.</hi> 21.4. <hi>Is my Complaint to man?</hi> If it was, it had been lawfull, but fruitleſs; No (q. d.)

I conclude with that of <hi>Daniel,</hi> one that ſenſed the Ruines of Gods Matters, deeply, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.17. (and who doth more) ſpeaking of the <hi>Roman</hi> Force on that Houſe. He ſhall plant the Tabernacle of his Pallace between the Seas, in the Mountain of Delights (Oh ſad) where his Peoples de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights were; and God did delight once to
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:151110:77"/>dwell. One concludes thus on't:<note place="margin">Ch. <hi>11.45.</hi> Huit in Loc. applies it to Turks, <hi>p. 343.</hi>
               </note> (And it reaches to all <hi>Mahometans</hi>) <q rend="inline">the <hi>Turk</hi> (now the terrour of the World) tho many run to him for a Refuge, ſhall, with all his <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſaries</hi> and Troops, be but broken Reeds, while he bears Arms againſt the People of God; for he ſhall find one to encounter him to his ſmart, for all his Rage; who will make <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> a Cup of trembling (<hi>Zac.</hi> 12.3.) and a burthenſome Stone to all that come againſt her.</q> And this I add what he ſays of him, is alike proper to all the <hi>Mounſiers,</hi> hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the like Rapine.

               <hi>Enoch,</hi> a Prophet!

God enquires after ſuch in all Ages, all Nations, and finds them; nay, makes them (<hi>Mal.</hi> 3.17.) his <hi>(Segulah)</hi> Jewels, or the peculiar Treaſure; communes (<hi>Gen.</hi> 18. <hi>ult.</hi>) with them as with Intimates; ſeeks out for <hi>Moſes</hi> in <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Court, and <hi>Joſeph</hi> in the Dungeon: (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.70.) <hi>David</hi> in the Sheep-Penns; accepts a Suckling of <hi>Samuel,</hi> the heart being ſincere, yet rejects thouſands of Sheep and Rams of <hi>Saul,</hi> becauſe reſerv'd in a Rebellion to God.

            <p>Now doth God ſeek for Glory in, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward all them that fear and adore his reverend Name: and will he call them to his Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and not defend them in and for it? It would much degrade him below the Mighty Ones on Earth, that ſcorn to ſet a man to do, and not defend him in their Service; or at leaſt revenge the Prophanation of it.</p>
            <p>It was an Inſolency in <hi>Beltſhazzar,</hi> that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a Prophaner of Holy Veſſels, to carouſe his Healths in Gods Sacred Cups, (<hi>Dan.</hi> 5.23.) but it ended in an ill terrible Huzza.

               </note> and one cites for the former (as an Inſtance) <hi>Zonaras;</hi> that in <hi>Antioch</hi> a Judge ſaw (by the Stars ſo plac't) this Doom of <hi>Julian:</hi> (This day is he ſlain in <hi>Perſia</hi>) and that ſo fell out exactly.

So ſurely, God pleads the Cauſe of his <hi>Zion,</hi> executes the Vengeance (fore-writ) of his Temple, and ſo defends his Houſe, Son, Name, Service, and pure Worſhippers. So is the Grace promis't, under the Law: ſuch is his Nature, Power, Goodneſs, and Truth, that his Promiſes depend upon: the power of the Enemy alſo challenges it, the Prayers of his own cry for it; nay, the Lord ſeeks for, and prizes his own, counts them as the Apple of his Eye, (<hi>Zac.</hi> 2.8.) and all that devour them, offend him; Evil will befall them, and Experience ſeals alſo to it: <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.3.</p>

               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Why? 1. To put forth an Act of Grace, and Power (as with both hands) to lift us up again: <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaid, <hi>

And the Spouſe ſaid, <hi>His Left Hand is under my Head, and his Right hand embraceth me:</hi> Cant. 2.6. Surely, to be held up and preſerved, when our beſt Cordials below fail, is an Act of Power. To be trod in the Mire, and yet have God's bared Arm to lye under, is a ſweet ſtay, and will be after, a lift for us.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To prove his own in the Furnace of Man's Fury: <hi>Dan.</hi> 11.35. to try, purge, make white, try our Love to trampled Truth and Worſhip, make white, and rinſe out the Spots and Errours, in Devotion, and purge away all our Tin, Droſs, and Diſeaſes, that cleave to, and defile our Devotion, provoking God to leave us to Robbers, and let his holy Matters be prophaned. But</p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>3dly.</hi> To prepare the Wicked for the day of Vengeance (<hi>Prov.</hi> 1.32.) by proſpering them in all they attemnpt: that deſtroys them, pulls them (being fatted) out, as to the Slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: <hi>Jer.</hi> 12.2.3. Calls out all their rage and fury before hid, boyls their Galls up till they burſt, fills their Cup with ſweeteſt bloods, and ſo they drink themſelves dead: and in the wiſe diſpenſation of Juſtice, no means (uſed
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:151110:81"/>before) mollifying; and is perverted to the contrary, as the Anvil, by many blows, is hardened the more; and what the warm Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beams emolliate not, grows the harder there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by; ſo theſe indurate with often heats of Wrath, are, as <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaks, prepared for ruine, <hi>Job</hi> 21.29.30. by Tokens and Brands (as in the Forehead) to read their Fall, by the por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervouſneſs of their Acts, on ſo ſlippery a Precipice; and no ſins, like Sanctuary Abuſes, are ſo bulky to fill up, no Vengeance heavier, than that of the Temple: <hi>Jer.</hi> 50.28.</p>
            <p>But ſeeing I have objected 3 or 4 Inſtances, I'll touch them in particular before I proceed.</p>
            <p n="1">1. For that of <hi>Eli</hi>'s Time, I yield it, the Ark was took; no outward Symbole of a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence gives ſecurity from Violence, if any Male Adminiſtration in Worſhip, doth per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turb the holy Gods abode among us: all Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, Offices, Church-Priviledges, do make our guilt heavier, rather than exempt us from Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, and make our doom more heavy and hot to ſink us, as one drowned, or burn in Armour, which is the more terrible: the Sin of <hi>Eli</hi> was (both as a Judge and Father) great, to let the young Lads play the Tyrants (and that for God's ſake) over the Men, defile the Women at God's Doors: (1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.22, 23, 27, 29. <hi>ch.</hi> 3.13.) feed Luxury with the fat of the Lords (Offerings, inſult with their three forked hook (and by their Servants too) <hi>i. e.</hi> Luſt, Ambition and Tyranny over the People,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:151110:82"/>kick at the Lords Offerings, and deſpiſe Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition too; ſo cauſing the Lords People to tranſgreſs, for they abhorred his Offerings: and to be (by the Old Man) ſo gently chid, with, <hi>Nay, my Sons,</hi> and not frowned on, <hi>v.</hi> 13. it was guilt, with God, unexpiable: and by the puniſhment now threatned, appears; and ſome hundreds of years after (by <hi>Solomon</hi>) fulfilled. So that when Rulers neglect their Duty, are indulgent to near Sinners: and Prieſts pervert ſacred things, to feed private Rapine and Luſt. No wonder, if God aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons that <hi>Shiloh,</hi> abhor the Altar, and viſit that Tent no more: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.60.</p>
            <p n="2">2. For that firſt Captivity, in 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 36. that Place it ſelf pleads the Juſtice of that Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, for the ſinful Provocations of the People, and Obſtinacy againſt the Lords Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warnings by his Prophets: the reaſon of which is given, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 36.15. (and in that lies the Emphaſis and force of all) for he had compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion on his People and Dwelling Place: that Place on which they had no pity, but fill'd and defil'd it with Strangers and <hi>Babylonians</hi> came into the Bed of Love with them, being all lovely and gay: as <hi>Ezekiel</hi> ſays, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 23.14, 15. to 17. Nay, they polluted it with the blood of the beſt Prophets: <hi>Iſaiah</hi> is ſawn in ſunder, <hi>Zachariah</hi> ſtoned, <hi>Jeremiah</hi> impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned, <hi>&amp;c.

<pb n="145" facs="tcp:151110:82"/>his; <hi>Ezek.</hi> 43.7, 8, 9. ſo they were drove all (as <hi>Eli</hi>'s Sons before) from the Altar: it caſt off, the Houſe and City diſmantled and and burnt up.

            <p n="2">2. By way of concluſion or limitation, to ſet bounds of reſtraint (as he did on the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Mount, <hi>Exod.</hi> 19.23.) for God's Worſhip is ſtill his holy Hill, and he is as tender of <hi>Zi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> as he was of <hi>Sinai:</hi> the touching her is as criminal; tho it be an improper ſaying for us to uſe of the Almighty; yet in two places he owns (in a ſort) that he was afraid (<hi>Gen.</hi> 11.6. <hi>ut Vatabl. hi firmâ conſpiratione conglutina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti ſunt.</hi>) At <hi>Babel</hi>'s Building; now is no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint to what they imagined to do (but a Sarcaſme) <hi>q. d. O now they'l ſcale my Throne ſurely, yea, quickly; I am afraid, if I go not down to them, they'l be up at me.</hi> Well, he confounds and divides their tongues. If that be not ſo plain, this next is expreſs; I ſaid, <hi>I will ſcatter them:</hi> (that is a ſad threat) God can do it eaſily: what hinders? why he fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed (<hi>Deut.</hi> 32.26, 27.) the Enemies Wrath, and behaving ſtrangely, and ſaying, <hi>Our hand is high, God has not done it.</hi> A ſtrange behaviour may be in men, but that God fears it, is ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger: what a behaviour is that? <hi>(ne extraneê ſe gerant, ne ſuperbirent)</hi> proudly and ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:151110:85"/>that is, imputing all to their Nets, Power, and Policy; not owning God in it at all. God foreſees what proud Inſultings and Inſolencies the Enemy ſwells to, over his ſcattered ones; what his Name alſo will ſuſtain by their deeds, the one, by blaſphemies; and the other, by Cruelties; He fears the iſſue, and wiſely pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents both.</p>
            <p>Now the Meditation is as ſweet of this, as of the other tremendous; to ſee the bounds and limits, the ſtrong hooks and invincible lines that the unruly <hi>Leviathans</hi> are held by, when the Lord lets them play in this World's Sea, and toſs his Ark, as if under no reſtraint, or <hi>Legibus ſoluti;</hi> and theſe are his holy rails (to ſpeak <hi>al-a-mode</hi>) ſet to defend his Altar and ſacred Miſteries, from impure hands.</p>
            <p>Now, though it is granted, God in wiſdom doth allow Line enough to the wicked to a great length of time, to do what they will, as (as with <hi>J. Bp.</hi>) <hi>Mat.</hi> 17.12. and ſometimes bids what he never commands: as when he bad <hi>Shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mei</hi> curſe <hi>David,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.11. and <hi>Judas,</hi> what he meant, do quickly <hi>Joh.</hi> 13.27. Yet ſtill we may hold the fore-hinted Aſſertions, that God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends his own Matters ſoon or late; oft, ſpeedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; ever after a while, perhaps, in the act, againſt all Aſſailants whatever.</p>
            <p>More particularly, conſider it thus; 1. Tho God's Name may be blaſphemed at a high rate, for a time; which brings both rebuke and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs on all that love him:<hi>Iſaiah</hi> 37.3. yet
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:151110:86"/>he that made that Law, to ſtone the Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, will ſee it executed, either by ſome hand, as on <hi>Goliah</hi> with a ſling-ſtone, <hi>Dan.</hi> 2.45. or without hand, as <hi>Rabſhekah</hi> and his Maſter, <hi>Ch.</hi> 8.25.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Though Chriſt may ſuffer by his own, and <hi>Judas,</hi> for gain, may ſell his Maſter, <hi>Luk.</hi> 23.25. yet that age ſees his blood revenged in the ſpeedy death of <hi>Judas,</hi> and the ſale of the <hi>Jews</hi> (by 30 a penny) that bought his precious life at a Traytors hand for 30 pence.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Though the Truth may be truſt out, and fail, and fall in the Streets, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 59.4, 14, 15. and ſo be liable to be trampled on, yet God, whence it derives, will raiſe it up, and ere long, tread on them that oppoſed it, <hi>Dan.</hi> 8.12. lift up a Banner for it in that ſame age, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 60.3. and chaſe them away with a blaſt that rejected it, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 59.19. for, <hi>magna est veritas, &amp; prevalebit.</hi>

            <p n="5">5.

<pb n="150" facs="tcp:151110:87"/>are crimes flagitious, and ſo crying in God's ears, that they frequently bring down Reven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges from God, the defender of the Upright, when none elſe can do it: and for the way; though oft it be done in a convincing, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting way, as on <hi>Paul,</hi> in the Career and heat of his fury, <hi>Acts</hi> 9.31. which gave a bleſſed breathing to Religion: yet ſometimes in the act of our Worſhip (as <hi>Bazil</hi> at Prayer, and Chriſt at apprehenſion, <hi>JOhn</hi> 18.6.) ſome time after God appears, at the beſt time: to ſtop Perſecution, or judicially to take off the Perſecutors themſelves, or unhinge, divide, prevent, or elſe plague them; and ſo defends his People.</p>

            <p n="1">1. Hence it Informs us of 5 Points.</p>
            <p n="1">1. How dear and chary is God of right Worſhip; Angels are called to it, <hi>Adam</hi> muſt not be in Paradiſe without it; the <hi>Jews</hi> ſay, he was made the Evening before the Sabbath, that he might begin his Rule over the Creatures, in the Service and Contemplation of his Creator, his true Reſt: his Laws for it, that Reſt and ſweet ſavour that he took (<hi>Gen.</hi> 8.21.) in it; all ſhow the tender care he was about it, his Precepts to ſet bounds for it, and Promiſes to the due Performers, the threats of all that vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olate it, and Puniſhments ſo oft inflicted thereon, do all evince the care he has of it, and all that delight in it.</p>
            <p>The Deliverances that he wrought of old for his People, and Revenges on their Foes, (which oft concur) were all in order to it; all the motions of the Wheels of Providence (of old, or of late) tend to ſhew his care; and all the acts of intercourſe betwixt God and Man, his love to it. <hi>There will I meet and bleſs thee</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.24. Which Altar typed the medium of acceſs, Chriſt Jeſus. Would he place him as Mediator by Office, but to get and keep open the new way (bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than that old was) to the Father. Why ſeeks he ſuch Servants to do it in Spirit and Truth, but to hold up his Worſhip in the
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:151110:88"/>World? why was our Lord ſent, the Goſpel preached, the Gentiles called, but to ſhow this? nay, the Devils Emulation to divine honour, declares God's Right and Reſpect.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2dly.</hi> I infer, exact Piety is extream peril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous at times among men: (were it not, God owns it) I ſay, not always ſo, ſometimes, not at all: but there are times when Religion (called pure) is perillous to purſue; and the purer, the more: carnal Policy thinks it ſo; where Piety is followed too cloſe at the heels (ten to one) it may daſh out his Brains. No danger of being too High or too Rich; — but all the danger is, in being too Godly. Now it may ſuffer <hi>Odium</hi> at any time, but 'tis moſt dangerous in ill times, when the <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> that had an old hate to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> are over them; now 'tis an offence to ſharpen a <hi>Plowſhare,</hi> or to ſacrifice to any God but <hi>Dagon</hi> (a ſtock) as well as to wear a Weapon, or uſe it. All that will be right Worſhippers, ſhall ſuffer; (a general Rule) and Exceptions to it, are rare, if a man comply to bow in the Idol's Temple, truckle under <hi>Dagon,</hi> cajoule his Conſcience, adore a worldly Sanctuary, conſult carnal Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy, Faſhion, Cuſtome of Men, he may eſcape; (yet not always ſo) but if he rides a little faſter (and with Chriſt) <hi>ſet his Face fully</hi> (Luk. 9.51.) <hi>towards</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>turn the Back to</hi> Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel, <hi>and look to</hi> Zion: This is <hi>Schiſme,</hi> the other <hi>Hereſy;</hi> to hold to <hi>Birth right,</hi> that is <hi>Blaſphemy,</hi> as <hi>Naboth</hi>'s was: the <hi>Boars</hi> Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:151110:88"/>(or Tuſhes) ſhall be ſure to meet in the Name or Eſtate, the Liberty or Profeſſion of one that deſigns more preciſenes than others.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>3dly.</hi> Learn we what Worſhip we ſhould own and practiſe, in a time of Conteſt betwixt God and Baal, the Ark and Dagon, or Chriſt and Antichriſt; ſurely, if any be right, it is that God owns, and ſuch there were then, have been ſince, and is, and will be, till this Controverſy is decided.</p>
            <p>Now (the Cauſe ſtill depending) no ſafer guide in the Night, no clearer Pole Star to ſtear a right Courſe by, than this alone; to enquire where, or on whoſe ſide God is, not where danger and profit lyes; but, O where is the Lord? on what ſide is he? his part we will all take, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.8. Would Princes, Prieſts, and People, ſay and do ſo, the better ſide would ſtill be the bigger: but when (as moſtly it is) Truth has the feweſt, only God, and a few Underlings on its part, and the foul end of the Staff; and all others are great, high, rich, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: now againſt theſe to bear up (againſt the Tide and Wind) is a good Courſe, a ſign of Life: alas, as the Prophets man, or <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonus</hi>'s Souldier, how apt are we to droop, and ſay, (Oh how many!) all are againſt me: but as both anſwered, <hi>How many is a God?

He in Worſhip that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heres to Gods part, though hence ſtiled <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick,</hi> is on the right; he that doth not, is an Idolater, or <hi>Eraſtian-ſceptick,</hi> and like white Paper yet to ſeek. —</p>

            </p>
            <p>For the 1ſt. (I mean, the more refined ſort) there are four or five Notes inſeperable from that Sin:</p>
            <p n="1">1. It has many bad adjuncts, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 21.8. is a black Liſt; eye but the firſt and laſt of the eight in all: 1. The fearful; that frights un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it; and laſt, all Lyars, are the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants; it is a Lye objectively, it is Worſhip to a Stock-God: a Lye mediately, upheld by Proditions, vile Perjuries, Subornations, Formally ſo; the Truth of Chriſts Doctrine being not in it: finally ſo, it ends in Perditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſo deceives eternally.</p>
            <p n="2">2. 'Tis a gay, gaudy, and ſence-pleaſing thing, love Feaſts, Feſtivals, Sports, and May-plays, Laces and Faces, Paints and Pictures, Copes and Cowles, Meat, Mirth and
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:151110:93"/>Muſicks: and ſo did the <hi>Calf, Exod.</hi> 32.6. (a Spice of which yet remains) So did thoſe <hi>Organiſts,</hi> in <hi>Amos</hi> 6.5, 6. and that golden <hi>Lubber</hi> in the Plain of <hi>Dura,</hi> muſt be dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by ſix ſets of Muſick, and four times re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated, <hi>Dan.</hi> 3.5, 7, 13, 15. only three brave Youths marred the Conſort, by Nonconformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: but it was for the Kings Good.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>3dly.</hi> A mad beſotting Sin; it infatuates, and faſcinates: <hi>The Idolaters are madly bent on their Idols,</hi> Jer. 50.38. unman themſelves below Reaſon, cannot ſay, <hi>Is not a Lye in my Right Hand?</hi> Iſai. 44.17, 20. 46.8. To think of adoring a Deity of his own make: or that ſort, <hi>Artolatry;</hi> to believe five Latin words converts a <hi>Wafer</hi> to a very real God, and then, as Canabals, to devour it.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Idolaters are cruel even to their own Fleſh, Sacrifice their Sons to <hi>Molock,</hi> ſhed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent blood; Plots, Maſſacres and Murders are ſo far from being eſteemed Crimes, that with them Parricide, Fratricide, Rigicide, are among their Heroick Acts: if but for the Intereſt of Holy Church, they can dreſs up <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels Whore</hi> and <hi>Flora</hi> for <hi>Zion,</hi> and then build up that <hi>Zion</hi> with Blood, <hi>Mica.</hi> 3.10.

            <p n="5">5. Idolatry is Stubbornneſs and Rebellion; no adviſe here obtaine: <hi>Saul</hi>'s Will is for God to him, and he will obey his People rather than God, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.23. 'Tis ſad to ſee ſome men dye, as Sacrifices to their own obſtinate humour: Inadvertency (if that Prophet ſays true, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 25.16.) was an ominious ſign that <hi>Amaziah</hi> (and for this Sin) muſt periſh: be it <hi>Amoz</hi> (as the <hi>Jews</hi> ſay) or ſome elſe, he reads that mans Fate too true: and by a Conſpiracy he ſoon after dyes.</p>

Here the definition of it lyes; it is not ſo denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, unleſs it be for Righteouſneſs and Truths ſake: and the Cauſe, not the Suffering; makes the Martyr. Two things let me touch here; 1. the Riſe: 2. the unreaſonableneſs of it. For the Riſe of Perſecution, it muſt be trac't back to the Original: it is a Birth ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding the Fall; all Perſecution comes by Succeſſion, Serpentine, Draconical, and Papal, each in kind, the worſt; you Perſecutors ſee your Antiquity, you derive from, and before the Fall, which (is ſaid) was on the ſixth: the Angelick Apoſtacy was before (ſay, the firſt, or fourth day) <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.14.19. But ſure early Satan ſuborns the Serpent, and (by
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:151110:96"/>a lye to the Woman) to gull and tripp man, and all the Race, <hi>Ch.</hi> 3.2, 5. So the Fall not only broke a bone, but loſt a Faculty; and that of the Eye, not of the Body, but Mind too. And yet the Root is deep, God put Enmity betwixt the two Seeds (never yet irradicated) and the diſpute is early about Worſhip, ſo ſoon as two Brothers came, they talk, differ in Worſhip, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.2.7. <hi>Cain</hi> (the High Prieſt) is ſleighty, <hi>Abel</hi> gives God the Fat, the firſt and beſt: <hi>Cain</hi> being outdone, kills for Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ſake, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.12. Here is a Map of what hath been ever ſince: it is a Prieſthood that derives of <hi>Cain,</hi> to kill, for ſeeking to pleaſe God better than himſelf did: ſo it is now. <hi>Nimrod,</hi> a Rebel (as that word derives) holds up the Race; a Hunter (that is, of Souls) before the <hi>Lord,</hi> Gen. 10.9. that is, in Gods Preſence, and for Worſhip. So did <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> after the Fleſh to <hi>Iſaac, Ch.</hi> 21.9. (born after the Spirit) though in a lower kind, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.29. It is called but a Mock (as you forſooth, are a Separate; a Son of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, I hate that) and Hatred is Murder and Perſecution. Nor are <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s Brethren quit of this Envy, <hi>Gen.</hi> 37.4.5. <hi>Acts</hi> 7.9. They plot his Exile, and Conſcience is ſtruck at, for his Prophetick Dreams, and telling his Father their ill report: and the way they took ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified all he ſaid, and more. This Enmity is writ indelebly in the Race. But of all Types, the Allegory of <hi>Sarah</hi> and <hi>Hagar</hi> (and that
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:151110:97"/>of <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau</hi>) are apteſt Reſemblances of the two Churches: the falſe (that genders to Bondage) and the free Covenant-Seed, the Race of Seekers, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 24.6. For as <hi>Sarah</hi> was the true Wife, but ſeized by <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Court for her Beauty, (<hi>Gen.</hi> 12.15.) and ſo in hazard of forcing; but <hi>Hagar</hi> only a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubine, and at the laſt, ſhe and the Lad caſt out for Diſobedience; So fares it with Chriſt's Spouſe, her Spotleſs purity lays her open, to every black <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> or <hi>Abimelech,</hi> that hath power to ſeize her; who not yielding to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filement, is liable to force. As to the two Sons, <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau,</hi> they were both of <hi>Iſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ac,</hi> lay in one Womb at one, ſtrove for <hi>Primo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geniture,</hi> yet one got it, <hi>Jacob</hi> took <hi>Eſau</hi> by the heel, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 12.3. And all along they were at odds and varied: <hi>Eſau</hi> games in the Field, <hi>Jacob</hi> is a plain Man at home: that of a rough threatning Spirit, Speech and Hand; this of a tender Spirit, an Exile in Condition, a Wreſtler in Prayer, one oft in <hi>Bethel</hi> with God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32.24. So it is now (in all Points) ſee the diſparity in nothing more than in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; this was ſtill <hi>Jacob</hi>'s ſtudy and glory, and he got (at laſt) the Bleſſing by it: the other prized it but as a Meſs of Pottage (ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane) yet God gave it <hi>Jacob,</hi> and <hi>Eſau</hi> for it, hated him: and this old hate lives ſtill in the <hi>N. T.</hi> The very firſt Perſecutor <hi>(Herod)</hi> was an <hi>Idumean, Mat.</hi> 2. and that Race lived in <hi>Steven</hi>'s, in <hi>Peter</hi>'s, in <hi>Paul</hi>'s Time, <hi>Acts</hi> 7.
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:151110:97"/>
               <hi>Ch.</hi> 12.2. till the Womans Perſecution, and to her Seed, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 12. <hi>ult.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And ſo I derived it, <hi>ab Origine.</hi> Some ſay, the <hi>Papiſts</hi> hold the Unction of Prieſts, a more ſacred one than that of Kings: and if they and their Kings both be Perſecutors, that Unction is of the Oyl of <hi>Scorpions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. But a further account of its Riſe may be took thus, from the Light of Truth, and Beauty of Holineſs, and Purity of Worſhip own'd; ſome Truths are of a biting nature: <hi>Noah</hi> condemned the Old World, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.7. and <hi>Lot</hi> Judged <hi>Sodom, Gen.</hi> 19.3. and that could neither of them bear; nor can it but irritate, where ever it comes.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Alſo from the Ignorance of Men's Minds that are purblind and eaſily miſled, by a Zeal, not according to knowledge, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.2, 3. This <hi>Paul</hi> (after his Eyes are open) confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes againſt himſelf, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.13. and that he verily thought he ought to do ſo againſt the Name of Jeſus, <hi>Acts</hi> 26.9. <hi>Ch.</hi> 13.50. 14.2. but in mercy God ſhewed him better things af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
            <p n="4">4. But it oft flows from devout Zealots, and Semi-Chriſtians, (<hi>Phil.</hi> 1.15.) that by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice and miſtake (that way they ſet) cauſe many of the Vulgar to bandy with them, and ſo do raiſe Perſecution againſt any, they fancy to have a new way to Heaven.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Beſides, the Prieſthood are moſtly in the Van, both of the <hi>O. T.</hi> and the <hi>N.</hi> Theſe
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:151110:98"/>do blow the Coals of Envy, and vulgar rage, and ſeek to blow out the fire of God's Altar. The Sons of the Prophets are Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to Propheſy, and they that ſhould nouriſh Light, hate it. <hi>Amos</hi> 7.10.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Alſo needleſs Diviſions and Animoſities do oft conduce to it, not a little; if the beſt vary and part in Judgment, Affection, and Way, it corroborates the Minds and Hands of all that long to extinguiſh the whole Party. Oft our Alterations and Scuffles bring the Ball to the Foot of them that ſay, <hi>[Divide &amp; Impera.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. Sometimes Affairs change alſo, and the Wheel of Providence rowls about, turning under all that were upmoſt afore; and thoſe that lay at the foot, to be over the head, both in Pride and Power; inſulting (though the vileſt Abjects with God and Men) over the beſt of Perſons for Parts and Place; (as the fly, the Wheel.) O what duſt theſe raiſe, till God rowles them off.</p>
            <p n="8">8. But no Womb more productive of Fury againſt Religion, than turns in the Rulers and Regiment of this World: as all ſubſolar Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs do naturally toſs, roule and fluctuate; all that precide being mutable in Judgment: and Mortals; ſo oft they vary their Courſes and Councils, as the Wind (whoſe Points are many) and emergent Intereſts vary. When that <hi>Roman</hi> Emperial Dragon, for three or four hundred years ſwayed; O what Seas
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:151110:98"/>of Chriſtian Blood was ſpilt, by ten fierce Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions: and ſome roſe from the <hi>Odium Nero</hi> put on the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Name, burning <hi>Rome,</hi> and laying that on them, and ſo cryed, <hi>(Chriſtiani ad Leones)</hi> Thus he firſt dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Chriſtian</hi> blood on the Altar; that yet crys, <hi>HOW LONG? Apoc.</hi> 6.9. And let an ill Name be true or no, if Grandees ſay it, the Sufferer has no Relief, but Patience and Crys to God. And in Places where <hi>Idolatry</hi> and <hi>Paganiſme</hi> obtain, nothing but rage is to be expected; and (which is pity) where the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Name only is pretended, under the vain glorious Titles of the moſt <hi>Catholick,</hi> or moſt <hi>Chriſtian.</hi> Alas! how is Power made the Lacquey to all the <hi>Papal</hi> Slaughters, that the Inquiſitors, the Prieſthood, and their flyes can poſſibly cauſe; and the Rulers themſelves ſubjected to the Luſts of them, that make rage their reaſon: the Kingdoms as Shambles, and Authority a naked Cleaver (or Lictor) to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute their Fury.</p>
            <p>But where <hi>Proteſtancy</hi> is profeſt (and upon its Declination) how many (high and low, that had taſted of its Light) are there, that were never inebriated into the Love of its Truth, nor the Power of its Piety and Purity, that if a ſubtile <hi>Jeſuit</hi> gets their Ear (or an envious <hi>Haman</hi> their Favour) can eaſily be wheedled to renounce that Profeſſion, and (for their holy Fathers Bleſſing) eſpouſe their
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:151110:99"/>own Fathers Curſe, and Gods too, by Apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy from the God of their Fathers.</p>
            <p>Now if a great Man falls out of the Saddle, or be kickt off by a natural Death, and another mount, and get the Reines (as has oft been) O how eaſily will the hand of the Rider reine about (with the Head) the whole Body (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing jaded firſt) to profeſs a new Faith and perſecute the old.</p>
            <p>Now here among the Shelves, and Syrts, I am (betwixt <hi>Sylla</hi> and <hi>Charybdis</hi>) under fear of <hi>Paul</hi>'s <hi>Euroclydon,</hi> and glad to cry to the Helm, <hi>No near</hi> — (as the Mariners do) leaſt I fall (as once the <hi>Royal-Oak</hi> ſplit) on thoſe Rocks — the Biſhops and Clarks.

Here let me a little reaſon it out with ſome of this Spirit, and then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move Allegations urged for it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. What is that we call properly Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:151110:99"/>Is it not an eager purſuit of Brethren, in the Cauſe of Religion, for not yielding to that in Worſhip, that in Conſcience is judged Sin, or doing that which you account againſt Law.

You ſay, that Compellation is not due to us; yet if God allow it us, who will deny it?

            <p>It once obtained a proclaimed Indulgence, and if there be no probability for that again, I ſay, Why? what has been, may be again; if the Intereſt be as pungent as was then, Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Moderation may ſtir the heart ſoon, to the ſame calm courſe: if ſome ſay, it was in pity to the <hi>Roman</hi> Cauſe; that I do not know, nor dare not ſay; it is more Charity to ſay, it was a favour to the <hi>Diſſenters;</hi> but who dare judge the ends of it, or deny that the thing is good, 'twas then ſo, and being ſo
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:151110:103"/>repeated, many will be content and thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</p>
            <p>It has obtained in Parliaments Votes, that to proſecute the Law againſt us, was unſafe to the King and Kingdom, and a promoting the Plot; though one has moſt impudently in Print oppoſed his Opinion to the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a Houſe of Commons in that.</p>
            <p>It has obtained in Charters, and Municipal Fundamental Laws; if that <hi>Maxim</hi> hold, <hi>That any Law againſt Gods Word, is</hi> (ipſo ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re) <hi>void and deemed null.</hi> (Of that more anon)</p>
            <p>It has gained with great Nobles, Pears, and Counſellors, that as they once adviſed to let Worſhippers go free, (<hi>Exod.</hi> 10.7.) ſo have many ſince. It is ſaid of <hi>Francis</hi> I. of <hi>France,</hi> being about to perſecute the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rindol,</hi> and <hi>Cabriers,</hi> he is informed by Lord <hi>Langay,</hi> Governour of that Province, they were Harmleſs Men, Juſt, Laborious, Loyal to their Prince, to the Poor Charitable, in Prayers fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent: (as Cardinal <hi>Sadolet</hi> was alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc't) So at preſent he forbore; till <hi>Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> (a turbulent fellow) informs the King, that 15000 of them were up in Arms: So they were cut off.</p>
            <p>Among <hi>Papiſts,</hi> this (though for their own ends) has got ground: witneſs the candid and brave <hi>Thuranus,</hi> that going in <hi>Paris</hi> Streets on that Maſſacre day, it forc't tears from him,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:151110:103"/>to ſee the barbarous uſage of <hi>Proteſtants</hi> there. And others ſaid the like of the <hi>Walden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And for this City, fince Sir <hi>Sa. St.—</hi> Mayoralty, when the conteſt was hotteſt with <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> how has God pleaded their Cauſe, and increaſt their numbers, vindicated their Innocency againſt all <hi>Sham-plots,</hi> and protect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them from Violence and Treachery, till this late and preſent ſtorm fell.</p>
            <p n="9">9. This Zeal is more hot than wiſe: good men may affect heats, but 'tis not well: and the Scriptures call the Zealots for Perſecution, to advert: <hi>Joſhua</hi> crys out againſt <hi>Eldad</hi> and <hi>Medad,</hi> propheſying in the Camp; and not among the Seventy Elders, with <hi>Moſes,</hi> Numb, 11. <hi>v.</hi> 26. This, at firſt ſight, ſeemed a ſinful Separation from God's Tent: what ſays <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes?</hi> Meek Soul; (ſays he, <hi>v.</hi> 29.) <hi>Doſt thou envy for my Sake? Would God all the People were Prophets, and God would put of his Spirit on them;</hi> (q. d.) <hi>So far am I from forbidding, that I do approve,</hi> v. 30. And ſo he did, in both his Plea for them, and after, preſence with them in the Camp. Here is a ſelf-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying Spirit; and call to mind again what I ſlipt before; but cloſe this, (and claſp both) with, that ſome of the Clergy, as late Biſhop <hi>Worth, Crafts,</hi> and two more of lower rank, but no leſs note, have, in <hi>Naked Truth,</hi> ſome Sermons for Moderation: and in four parts of a <hi>Pleafor Nonconformiſts,</hi> (by a grave in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious

Young <hi>John</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains to Chriſt, of one that did Chriſt's work, <hi>Caſt out Devils,</hi> but followed not with them; and ſo firſt, gave Interdiction, and after, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults Chriſt, (a prepoſterons percipitancy) <hi>Hyſteron proteron:</hi> our Interdictions are not by Chriſts Allowance; and ſo I hope, will be by him interdicted: Who dares to prohibit, that an other ſhould not caſt out Devils, eaſe Souls, (ſince none pretend to Miracles) and do our Countrey what good we can: we are not againſt Chriſt, and ſo he takes us on his part.</p>
            <p>A third Script—is that of the <hi>Tares,</hi> (Mat. 13.27, 38.) Where our Lord forbids the Servant (zealouſly asking leave) to pluck up the <hi>Tares: No</hi> (ſays the Lord) <hi>let both grow together till the Harveſt,</hi> &amp;c. Note hence, that if the Field be the World; the Tares, the Children of the Wicked One, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Then 'tis not meet to pluck up all ſorts of the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Ones in a Nation by bulk; be they <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, Schiſmaticks, Prophane,</hi> or <hi>detected (ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected) Hypocrites:</hi> they muſt and will grow in the World: nor is it the Miniſters work to preoccupate the Judgment, and be plucking
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:151110:104"/>up (by death) that is partaining to the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill Judge; nor is Church Power here forbid, or Civil Law and Juſtice ſuperceded to the Judgment; but Chriſt's Will is, that ſome wicked men are not to be rooted out of the World, for two reaſons:</p>
            <p n="1">1. 'Tis poſſible, with the <hi>Tares,</hi> the <hi>Wheat</hi> alſo may be pulled up; and ſo the good fall with the bad; <hi>Jethro</hi> an <hi>Iſhmaelite;</hi> and <hi>Ornan</hi> the <hi>Jebuſite,</hi> may turn <hi>Iſraelites; Luther,</hi> a <hi>Monk,</hi> and <hi>Vergerius,</hi> a <hi>Papiſt,</hi> may turn, and of <hi>Tares</hi> become <hi>Wheat.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. To kill, cut off, ruine by Fines and Curſes, is the way to undo; and ſays one There is no good Example in all Antiquity,<note place="margin">Jac. Aug. Thu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anus Proem <hi>in</hi> Hyſt.</note> for the Sectaries of thoſe firſt Ages being deſtroyed; the Church was ſtill tender, and abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to ſhed blood in Matters that concerned Religion and Conſcience. The matchleſs wiſe, though young <hi>Edward VI.</hi> preſt to ſign a <hi>Warrant, de Herctico comburendo,</hi> ſaid, <hi>What, ſhall I ſend him quick to Hell?</hi> The like may be ſaid of <hi>Mulcts</hi> of a lower ſort: and what amends comes by the Penalty? or is there any proportion in the pain to the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence? A man may not ſee with my eyes, or has a <hi>Mote</hi> in his; and to cure that, ſhall I cut off his head, or put out the other eye, that I may lead him where I liſt? A ſad Cure!</p>
            <pb n="186" facs="tcp:151110:105"/>
            <p>Then a fourth Scrip— gives the advice of a wiſe Counſellor, or Doctor (as <hi>Nicodemus</hi> ſaid to the <hi>Jews</hi>) <hi>Doth our Law Judge a man</hi> (by <hi>Fines, Incarcerations,</hi> &amp;c.) <hi>ere it hear him?</hi> Joh. 7.50, 51. That is called, <hi>Abington Law</hi> (or <hi>Stanery's</hi>) that did hang in the Forenoon, and try in the After. Or elſe (as that wiſe <hi>Gamaliel</hi> ſaid) <hi>Refrain from theſe Men, and let them alone,</hi> Acts 5.39.40. The ſame alſo gave the Lord's <hi>Brederode,</hi> &amp;c. in their Apology, that the States of the Lower <hi>Germany</hi> publiſht 1566 for themſelves, in ſeparating from <hi>Popery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But that no juſt <hi>Objection</hi> may lye in barr of the deſigned Apology for our late Perſecuted <hi>Diſſenters;</hi> I will modeſtly diſcourſe and diſperſe the ſix <hi>Objections</hi> following:</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>The Worſhip and Worſhippers pleaded for, are an Offence and Violation to the Laws of the Land: and may we look God will be our Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in that, that Law calls us offenders?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To that, I ſay, four things:</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Caſe is true, not new. So it was of old, when Saints were under, and Enemies over them, that Laws ſtill were the Laſhes, if evil; and thoſe of their God, a ſcandal, or bridge in the Trap to take them withal. In <hi>Aegypt,</hi> the Laws of Worſhip ſo vaſtly differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in <hi>Object, Matter,</hi> and <hi>Mode,</hi> that what <hi>Iſrael</hi> offered, was an abomination to them,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:151110:105"/>
               <hi>Exod.</hi> 8.26. In <hi>Babilon</hi> the Songs of <hi>Zi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> were mockt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 137.7. And the Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Head made an Image, that all muſt adore, or hurn, <hi>Dan.</hi> 3.7. And did, all but three Youths? In <hi>Perſia</hi> was a Law, againſt any Prayer ſave to <hi>Darius,</hi> for thirty days. And <hi>Haman</hi> indites (to ſerve his Plot) all the <hi>Jews</hi> at once; <hi>That their Laws varyed from all, and they did not obey the Kings Laws,</hi> Eſther 3.8. And have not all Nations uſed that Laſh till blood come?</p>
            <p n="2">2. Though I plead not ignorance of Law, yet my ſtudy is the Law of the Goſpel: I know not a Statute that I have read out, in the laſt twenty years; and let it be counted a cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable Ignorance; I am loth to yield, that any Parliament of wiſe and good men could ever conceive an Act againſt Religion, or Prayer and Preaching as ſuch, or ſo quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied ſimply; no, it muſt be as Seditious, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs men will make Vertue and Religion cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal: and if the Preface of a Law ſhow the reaſon of it, and the body quadrate, no hurt can be, unleſs men execute out of Envy. If I miſtake, let my Charity plead ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Law is to be extinguiſht; ſome may be fundamental, as our <hi>Charters;</hi> againſt which none is valid, that truly contradict
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:151110:106"/>the ſame: ſome ſuperſtructive, that are va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riable, as Times, Perſons, Places, and Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances vary, and fall obſolete, uſeleſs and burthenſome; as that in <hi>Henry VII.</hi> Reign was, which <hi>Dudly</hi> and <hi>Empſon</hi> executed, by oppreſſive extortion: let Laws but ſtand equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollent to Reaſon, equivalent to Juſtice, and ſubjected to Scripture, none can hurt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Some Laws invade Gods Legiſlation, that are, or have been made to reſtrain the Good, and puniſh the Virtuous; to diſobey them, is the Praiſe of our Obedience to God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.23.27. As the Inſtances of <hi>Moſes</hi> and his Parents; of <hi>Daniel</hi> and the three Children; of <hi>Eſther,</hi> (Eſth. 4.16.) of which Courage (and her Exciter <hi>Mordecai</hi>) one ſays, <hi>(Trap.) Mira profecto, ac omnibus linguis ſaeculis lociſqne comendabilis fides:</hi> won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful and laudable Faith, and that in all <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guos, Ages,</hi> and <hi>Places</hi> too. As <hi>Achillis</hi> was <hi>(Styge armatus)</hi> ſo ſhe; and all true Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippers ſhould be <hi>(Deo &amp; Fide Chriſti ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mati)</hi> The Tryal of the Loyalty to the King, and love to the <hi>Liturgy</hi> was in his Exile; and the proof of a <hi>Chriſtians</hi> Obedience to Gods Laws, is beſt, and ſhines moſt, when oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by Law ſtanding in Diameter.
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:151110:106"/>Object. <hi>The Worſhip pleaded for, is an Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence to Authority, and can he defend that which offends his Ordinance?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It may be ſo, more is the Pity, that Gods Ordinances for Worſhip, ſhould offend his Ordinance for Government; that the Man of God ſhould not pleaſe them that rule for God; the Goſpel of Salvation ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfere with the Laws of a Nation, that ſhould ſubſerve it. This is, and muſt be for a Lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Worſhip pleaded for, if it pleaſe God, why ſhould it offend any, that perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate God? Is it our Duty to ſanctifie God, and to pray (in order to it) to know and to his Will, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.10. and when we have conſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, ſhall we prophane that Name, by do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what we are convinct, is contrary to his Will? This Offence is took, not given; and to be ſo, is part of our Miſery, not our Sin.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Though Polity and Maxims of State are not part of my Study, there being Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſention and Hereſyes in that, as well as in Divinity (not ſoon reconciled:) yet by two or three Scriptures, my Judgment beſt arrives at a conſiſtency, which ſteir my Courſe in Worſhip and Manners.</p>
            <pb n="190" facs="tcp:151110:107"/>
            <p n="1">1. Is that of <hi>Davids</hi> (dying words) after much Experience in Rule and Wars; <hi>He that rules among Men muſt be juſt, ruling in the Fear of God,</hi> 2 Sam. 23.3. And the Word is a ſure Rule of Juſtice and Worſhip.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That Power (<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

            <p n="3">3. That Obedience due to man, that is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led for from all, to ſupreme or ſubordinate Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, is not abſolute and univerſal, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.13, 14, 16.

Thus did <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> to avoid Gods Wrath, and ordered alſo both Rulers and Teachers to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct them, <hi>v.</hi> 23.25. Why may not Princes do the like now, for the ſame God they own?</p>

            </p>
            <p>To all this, let a few things be reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p n="1">1. If by Church be meant the Walls that the Pariſh meet in, or Vicinity there met; I do not ſee how either it can properly denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate it ſelf (Church) unleſs equivocally, as that Rout, (<hi>Acts</hi> 19. <hi>ult.</hi>) in <hi>Epheſus</hi> is ſtiled, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

               </gap> Yet no Church: could thoſe publick Aſſemblies be ſtiled, <hi>Oratories, Schools</hi> for the Sons of the Prophets, or Synagogues; then the parts of ſome grave, learned, pious Teachers (there exerciſed) would deſerve, audience, and in that ſenſe, more than do, would come. But (as a Church) 'tis, that many ſtumble at: and as the thing <hi>(Church)</hi> right defined, which ſhould <hi>(definito conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re)</hi> is underſtood, and (conſequently) the true nature of <hi>Schiſme</hi> is meaſured by it; you will gain few, and after looſe them as ſoon, and many more with them.</p>
            <p>And for your Church that you boaſt of, a <hi>Jeſuit</hi> long ſince ſaid it; <q rend="inline">You begin to look with a new Face;<note place="margin">Chillingworths Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, S. <hi>20.</hi>

            </p>
            <p n="2">2. This end will you never attain by the means uſed; reaſon will not be convinct by force, far leſs, religious Conſcience; which, though erronious, yet binds: Two ſorts you deal with:</p>
            <p n="1">1. Wiſe and wary Ones, that foreſee the wiles and ways you take, and being ſome of them old Souldiers, aged, rich, and politick; and you in a youthful Zeal, have learned to make a ſafe retreat, let you ſpend your heat, and ſhoot at a diſtance, till <hi>Papiſts,</hi> or elſe a <hi>Parliament,</hi> give you a rout.</p>
            <p>And a ſecond Party is on your Left-hand, very moroſs and ſtiff, reuounce all your Arts, and repell your Arguments for forct Religion; you call them <hi>Quakers</hi> (but a ſtout People) that tremble not at your facing them, ſtir not at your thruſts, keep their ground, though knockt down, give the back to your blows, repell all your Cannon-ſhot (that roar from <hi>Canterbury</hi> to <hi>Carlile</hi>) all your Courts, Oaths, Barrs, Benches and Fines, as Chaff: what to do with them, who knows? they grow under
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:151110:109"/>your inſultings, ſpread as <hi>Camomile;</hi> by your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſings. You diſlike them, and yet propagate them; your force unites and confirms them; and ſhould you awake the Old-man in them, the Lawleſs affronts they receive from trucu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent hands, were Provocation enough (and they numerous too) to put them in a Body, though weaponleſs, to face out all your fury. And if you be too weak for this forlorn, is it not wiſdom to give a deſperate Enemy a gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Bridge to go off, or eſcape, rather than to cruſh them: and if you ſay, my Plea leans (as the <hi>byas</hi>) too much that way; I ſay, no, many know I am none of them, and ſome of themſelves; but they are our Natives, of our own fleſh; and of late in publick Debates, have pleaded a little to the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Name; and if ſome (in heat) deemed them unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of it, yet their conſtant Patience and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude commends (if not their Faith) yet their Practice in rheir Meetings, being as the Bullwark (though of mudd) for blunting the edge of all force againſt their Meetings. And if you obtain not on them, whoſe Faith and Principle is ſo generally diſlik't, what can you do with the whole, that are more nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous? However (if we be <hi>Chriſtians</hi>) how can we hide our eyes, and not pity to ſee them buffeted, and robbed (but not they alone) clapt up in crowds, fined, beggered, cut and ſlain (as in Warrs) all to gratifie the ravine
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:151110:109"/>and malice of ſome poor Sycophant; that if <hi>Popery</hi> obtains, will ſwear againſt the beſt of us all.</p>

(but the King will ſurely relieve them:) Nay, into the hands of his King: if ſome rightly apply it unto the times of Chriſt's Paſſion: it denotes the Juſtice of the <hi>Roman</hi> Laſh upon them, for rejecting Chriſt, to have <hi>Caeſar:</hi> and crying, <hi>Not this Man, bt</hi> Barrabas, a Murderer: and (it follows too) <hi>Out of their hands I will not deliver them.</hi> And ſo it proved, for they that ſold their Saviour for thirty pence, were after ſold 30 for a penny by the <hi>Romans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. The provoking Cauſe of all, is the Root of the Lamentation, <hi>Lam.</hi> 1.14.

That is Gods Complaint, and that will be ours at laſt, elſe it will cut deep. How oft it made the doleful Ditty of the Song: <hi>The Crown is fallen— Now, Wo to us, that we have ſinned,</hi> Lam. 5.16. If Sin ſtruck off <hi>Joſias</hi>'s, and all his Succeſſors Crowns, and Lines, that no twig of that Race remained to hold Scepter, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 19.14. and yet he the beſt and tendereſt of Kings; what may they expect who are harden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?

            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly</hi> (and chiefly doleful) is the effect of God's Receſs, and withdrawing the Cloud of his Preſence, and our Protection, from not ours, but his own Tabernacle. This is the great thing to be bewailed. The <hi>Jews</hi> knit the laſt of <hi>Jeremiah</hi> and <hi>Lamentations</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (ſo the <hi>Septuagint</hi>) and read them on the <hi>9th.</hi> of <hi>June</hi> (call'd <hi>Ab.</hi>) the City then being taken by the <hi>Caldees,</hi> Jer. 52.7.

            <p>Two things may ſuffice here. The <hi>1ſt.</hi> effect of God's Receſs bears on Civil Rights and Matters: the <hi>2d.</hi> upon Spiritual, or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious: for it matters not which is toucht firſt: only their Riſe, Proſperity, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay, do contemporate.</p>
            <p n="1">1. If God depart from us, onr Humane, Civil Rights and Properties, and publick <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſes,</hi> are not like to ſtay long.

               <hi>3dly;</hi> We beſeech you, for your Maker's ſake, let Divine Laws in the Word obtain more, if not with you, yet with us. He that has magnify'd his Word above all his Name, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 138.2.) and will yet make it far more glorious, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.21. will not allow it ſubject to the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cits of Men; and thoſe that deſire to obey it (to a tittle) to be accuſed and deſtroy'd for reverence to it. To command prohibited Things, forbid what is commanded, is (both) an Arrogancy equally inſolent, and derogatory to the Divine Honour, to which we owe all our Homage.</p>
            <p>There are two binding Commands on us, that no Humane Law may relax, or diſcharge from: The firſt is the Law of the Sabbath; the ſecond, is that of Aſſemblies, or publick Gatherings to ſome one or other known Place, for the viſible Exerciſe of Devotion. The one enjoined in the Law of the Sabbath, or fourth Commandment, (<hi>Exod.</hi> 20.) which is as bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding on us, as that of the Jewiſh Sabbath was on them; and ſeal'd too, not with an Humane Sanction only, but witneſs'd by three Divine Paterns in the New Teſtament, (<hi>Acts</hi> 20.7. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.2. <hi>Apoc.</hi> 1.10.) and (ſince) by viſible Judgments, exhibited in all Ages, by God's own hand, on all ſorts of Violations and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaners.
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:151110:126"/>(Dr. <hi>Beard,</hi> Mr. <hi>Clark.</hi>) The other is expreſly enjoin'd by the Apoſtle to the belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Hebrews, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.25. <hi>Not forſaking your Aſſemblings</hi> (or Synagogues) <hi>as the manner of ſome is.</hi> And that Sect of the <hi>Nicodemites</hi> held, That a Man might retire from Obſervation of Perſecutors very lawfully, yet retain his Peligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God-wards. But a Diſpenſation allow'd once againſt the Divine Law, is to break God's Hedg, gratify fleſhly Force or Fear, and to make the reſt of God's Laws, as did the Phariſees, (with the fifth Command, by their <hi>Corban</hi>) all of none effect.</p>
            <p>Now for the firſt: O ye Nobles, Knights, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> hear my Plea for God's Sabboth.

O <hi>London!</hi> ſhall it be chronicled
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:151110:127"/>to thy Infamy, in the Records of ſucceeding Ages, that thou haſt done thus? Was it not a Glory to thee (of old) to own Religion, to honour God on his Day, and count it a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light and glorious ſo to do? And went it not well with this City, for the City of God's ſake? But now (O now) the Tide is turn'd, and the Wind blows ſharp, and high North, to the diſcouragement of ſuch as pretend any trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling at the Word, or Tenderneſs of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, Reverence to God's Day, or witneſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Roman or Pagan Feaſts.

               <hi>2dly;</hi> For Aſſemblies; I excuſe not Rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, nor the Carcaſe of Formality, which (as Mr. <hi>Shepherd</hi> of <hi>New-England</hi> very ſmartly fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tells) may juſtly cauſe God to ſend Crows and Vultures, or Roman Eagles, to pick our Carca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes barer; yet may I plead for reverend, learned, and pious Brethren as to this. My Plea for our Meetings ſhall be comprehenſive of all, that in Conſcience and Simplicity diſſent. Corrupt Latitudes on the one hand may be, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe narrow Spirits on the other, with different Perſuaſions (in ſome Points of Doctrine and Order) but extra-fundamental; and ſome lie open to more Offence than others: Yet I plead all their Cauſe and Rights, as to Aſſemblies, Presbyterian, Independents, Baptiſts, and Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, ſo diſtinguiſh'd by common Note (right or not.)</p>
            <p>For the firſt of them, Presbyterians, I ask any that can give a ſober Reaſon for that Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice took in againſt them, (others I deem not
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:151110:128"/>worth the while to expoſtulate with, that on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſay (without reaſon) they rather will chuſe Popery than presbytery to ſubmit to , till their Eyes are rubb'd open in <hi>Smithfield</hi>): But to the reſt I ſay, Ye've ſmall cauſe to ſeclude your Presbyterian Friends from Lenity and Charity; (the one calls to the Juſtices, the other to the Clergy); for thoſe (of that way) concurr'd and contributed to the King's Reſtoration as freely as any, and conſulted it too before, in a time when it coſt them no ſmall Hazard, and ſome Death, Moſt of them are Men of Parts, Education, Degrees in Univerſities, pious and charitable, very Loyal, and have a Latitude (many of them) to own your Church-Worſhip and Miniſtry, and alſo would return to you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, would you draw them by the Lenity of a Comprehenſion, not drive them by a Laſh of Compulſion: So you do owe them ſome Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, making Conſcience of that Covenant, the keeping whereof the late King himſelf re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended, in his <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

            <p>For the Independents, they are a ſmall, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct, aſſociated people, willing only (as that Doctor ſaid, in the <hi>Peace-Offering,</hi>) to paſs the King's High-way in Peace, with the ſmall Flocks that attend their Paſtors, giving (moſt of them, all) that Aſſurance, that the ſacred Oaths can afford: And being all laborious, ſome opulent, others poor, and neither offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>five to their Vicinity, nor yet mutinous or nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous; what harm can your Lenity do your
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:151110:128"/>ſelves, if you labour firſt to win them by Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, or (if that cannot be) to wait till God ſhall reveal his Mind to them, in what they dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from you? <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.15.</p>
            <p>For the Anabaptiſts; in point of Faith and Order, they ſay the ſame Things with the two former, little differing from you, ſave thoſe of the Free-will-Point, (of which Faith alſo are ſome of your own); only in Paedobaptiſm they very, finding no Law in the New-Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for Infant Baptiſm, and there being alſo too many found, whoſe Baptiſm wants of the Eſſence of that Ordinance. Were but the Odium took off them, that partial Hiſtorians of foreign Anabaptiſs do load them with; and the modern Urbanity, Sobriety, Charity, Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, and Piety they adorn themſelves with, (and Societies they own) preponderated; ſure the Errors of ſome of that (or any) Party ſhould not be imputed to all; there would be ſmall cauſe to cruſh, ruine, and ſpoil them, as Antimagiſtratical.</p>
            <p>Some amongſt theſe are alſo to be found, that are ſtigmatized, (and perhaps the whole for their ſake) as Chyliaſts, Millenaries, See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, and Seventh-day Me, (or Sabbatarians) Fifth-Monarchians, of which I need not be more particular. As they're few, mean, ſingle perſons, ſo alſo miſrepreſented, or not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood. One of your own <hi>(Conformiſts Plea, 4th Part.)</hi> diſtinguiſhes ſome (laſt nam'd) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to two ſorts: the one of Mr. <hi>Joſ. Mede</hi>'s Notion,
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:151110:129"/>who yet was of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and ſo not to be condemned for one innocent Error: But for the latter, if any brand us all with <hi>Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi>'s End, I adviſe ſuch to Thankfulneſs, that his Number was but Twenty Nine; for had they been ſo many Scores (or Hundreds) as Perſons, into what a Caſe and Fright they would ſoon have redacted Court, City, and Country, let them judg that ſaw the Action.</p>
            <p>For thoſe called Quakers I ſay not much, (having touch'd them before.) What is offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive and juſtly blameable in Doctrine, Order, or Moroſeneſs of Converſe, I here juſtify not; what is good (be it in Baptiſt or Quaker) I willingly own, (let it pleaſe, or not). One Thing I willingly prize and praiſe in them, (tho not in excluſion of others) <hi>i. e.</hi> their open Adherence, and their bold and noble facing the Armed; and keeping the ground without a Weapon, (tho it coſts ſome their Life) in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of their Meetings, at ſet Time and Place: Which, tho it infers not all true they ſay or hold, yet (in my Conſcience) it pleads a Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of the Practice, and is ſome amends for the diſuſe of the carnal Weapon with them; and 'tis to me the ſame Argument of brave, bold Manhood and Self Conduct, to give the Back and Cheek to Smiters, Goods to ſpoil, in the Exerciſe of Patience, as to give the Face to an Enemy at War in the Field. And very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable 'tis, for ſuch as come out to try their Valour (on thoſe unarmed Aſſemblies of Men,
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:151110:129"/>Women and Children) to think and ſee what Butts and Bulwarks they have to ſhoot at, and yet how firm ſtill they ſtand; for if the old Man and Manhood ſhould (by Injuries) be awaked, ſome that are ſo daring to give the provocation, would, to ſave their Faces, with the firſt turn the Back. Beſides, this People are grown numerous, and in all their own Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs keep correſpondence with their Friends mutually for relief of Sufferers, (and other good Ends) in all Parts. And (to invert <hi>Haman</hi>'s Argument, <hi>Eſth.</hi> 3.8.) 'tis not for the King's Honour or Profit, to let them be ruin'd at home, or exil'd abroad, that are ſo frugal, numerous and induſtrious. They alone may (by the Aſſemblies here in <hi>London</hi>) be calcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be a great Body; and with all the other ſorts of Diſſenters, both in the City, and all the Land, (in two Iſles) what a Body do they make!</p>
            <p>The wiſeſt King has a Political Maxime, <hi>In the Multitude (or Plenty) of a People, is the King's Honour; but in the Want of People, is the Deſtruction of the Prince. Prov.</hi> 14.28. Dr. <hi>Jermin in loc.</hi> p. 296. reads the firſt Clauſe <hi>[Berab gnam]</hi> as incluſive of both <hi>Numbers,</hi> and <hi>Plenty of Eſtate.</hi> Many in Miſery makes the Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry greater, and the Honour of the King leſs; but when People are not preſerv'd in their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or well-being, it begins with the Peoples Loſs, ends with the Princes Ruine. They are the King's Trophy and Treaſure. <hi>Meſſis noſtra
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:151110:130"/>cunctorum quies;</hi> Our Harveſt is the Quiet of all, ſaid a Goth King. <hi>Plato</hi> ſays, Never King periſh'd for want of money, but of Friends. When all left <hi>Nero,</hi> now began his Miſery, ſays <hi>Tacitus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now on them two things hangs the Being, nay, the Well-being of People, as the Jews ſay of Firſt-fruits and Tenths; the whole Revenue of God's Honour, our Peace and Comfort, reſts on theſe two Pillars, <hi>Jachin</hi> and <hi>Boaz;</hi> ſcatter the Aſſemblies, and the Sabbaths are forgot, (<hi>Law.</hi> 2.6.) and ſo God's Law is made void, and of none effect, (<hi>Mat.</hi> 15.6.) nad ſo 'tis time for God to work now. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.126.</p>

               <hi>4thly;</hi> I crave of theſe petty Kings (in cold Blood) to conſider, what all the Rigor both of Juſtices and Doctors has attain'd; for the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt is one thing, the Attainment is another. 'Tis true, old Laws and new (of this Nature) Civil, Canon, Common, are all ſharp enough, and made keener by the Spirit in which, and Occaſion by which they're executed: Is ſevere Rigour, Brow-beating on the Bench, Thraſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Boaſts, inſolent Inſultings (at <hi>Doctors-Commons</hi>) ſtretching the Law to all the Heights that Wit and Malice can reach, Engines now fit to effect the Buſineſs of uniform Conformity, that never yet was, nor will be attain'd upon thinking People? Generous Minds receive no Impreſſion by Coertions; nay, if it comes that way, the Religion is the more abhorr'd for force, as that of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> is of the <hi>Indians,</hi> that
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:151110:130"/>being by Droves compell'd to the Water-Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, come out Chriſtians thus dipt and anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that the poor <hi>Indians</hi> ſay, If a <hi>Spaniard</hi> goes to Heaven, they'll never come there; ſuch is their Cruelty.</p>
            <p>O the deep prejudice, that ſuch ſcandalous harſh Severities of Chriſtians on each other lay in the way of the Converſion of Souls! I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, you may obtain on degenerate, low, cowardly Souls, that have <hi>animam proſale,</hi> that profeſs <hi>fidem venalem &amp; ephemeram,</hi> whoſe Soul and Faith is ſaleable to any Lord that will buy, whoſe Obedience is little better than that of brute Beaſts, that follow the Drove. But as Scripture is the higheſt Reaſon; ſo Obedience muſt be call'd the Obedience of Faith, or it's not current with God. <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.26. Fines and Civil Mulcts may empty the Purſe, waſte the Subſtance, beggar the Family, vex the Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow long. ere they open their Eyes, or change the Heart.

            <p>Conſider further, as to the Aſſemblies you now diſturb or ſcatter, you may eaſily win the Ground they are upon, but you drive them on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to another Spot; they will not ruffle with you, you are armed, they naked. The Officers
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:151110:131"/>you bring are either rough, or ſmooth and civill Men, that will never deſtroy Neighbours in the Service of God, (tho you fine, conſine, and hang them (too.) They would rather come and partake of our Swets, than diſturb us, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory our peaceable Meetings: They are Officers of Peace, not given to War, and ſuch as anſwer the Promiſe, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 60.17. <hi>I will make thine Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers Peace, and thine Exactors Righteouſneſs.</hi> And God has made them ſo by his Providence, your Rigor, and the Long-ſuffering of your Immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralities. But if you find Men out harſh and rough, here or there, (perhaps you may ſome) that are of your kidney, buſy Men, rough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>handed (as <hi>Eſau</hi>) hard of Face, worſe in Heart, looſe in Life, looſer in Conſcience and Principles, of debauch't Courſes, low forlorn Fortunes, and next to no Religion, (ſave that is upmoſt): Theſe you may whet and ſhar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, as Tools fit for <hi>Bonner,</hi> by hopes of the Gain of Extortion, and carouſing others (as they have ſpent their own) Eſtates, idlely; till ſome (by them wrong'd and robb'd) clap an Arreſt on them, or a Stone Doublet as hard as their Heart, and ſo mar their Hope; and how many have that way been undone? <hi>Vivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur ex rapto,</hi> to live on catching, is a Motto fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt for ſuch Men (in common) with Crows and Kites. Have you no fitter Officers of Law than ſuch Harpies and Wrens? Is't an Honour to Proteſtant —, Prelates, Juſtices, to ride on ſuch Scabs, (as the Hebrew calls them,

            <p n="2">II. May I ſay ſomewhat to the Clergy, and that ſort of Men, by what Dignities ſoever di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh'd, from the Pope, to the loweſt Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitary, Apparitor, or Informer.</p>
            <p>You I beſpeak, O Stars of the firſt Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and Princes of the Engliſh Sanctuary: Are you learned, and will you take the Key of Knowledg, and of Chriſt's Kingdom from us?
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:151110:132"/>Are you Prophets, and yet unfriendly to the Sons of the Prophets? Doctors, and yet refuſe us that ſaving Doctrine, that may edify us to the Kingdom of God?

            <p>Now you are the Fathers, that inherit all the Churches Liberties and Freedoms, which while you engroſs, ſhe is nevre like to poſſeſs; and is your paternal Love ſo low to us, that you would leave us Orphans to the Care of holy Mother, ſwadled up in her Rites, and expoſed to all that her Heirs and Succeſſors impoſe? But not hoping this ſhall ſteal into the hands of any ſuch, I will modeſtly ask of thoſe Perſons, that of late preſs ſo hard coming to the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon all Diſſenters, as if no Reaſon could be rendred for that Abſence. In their ſtead I'le cite what is alledged. As,</p>
            <pb n="240" facs="tcp:151110:133"/>
            <p n="1">1. They ſay, Your Church does not agree to the New-Teſtament Definition our Lord gives of a true Church, in Matter, Form, and Uſe. It is in Matter to conſiſt of viſible Saints, call'd and ſanctified in Chriſt; in Form, <hi>(quae dat eſſe)</hi> it holds a compact Unity of Spirit, in the Bonds of Peace and Love: In Uſe alſo, 'tis a Candleſtick for Light, a Pillar and Ground of Truth, (1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15.) not to expell or extinguiſh either. And till they ſee yours, <hi>(definito convenire)</hi> they dare not intrude into your Boſom with the Croud.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Some ſay, Your Miniſtry is not right, it quadrates not with the Apoſtolick Precept and Patern, (in <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi>) i.e. <hi>Sober, juſt, holy; not given to Wine, Railing; no Smi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters or Curſers; in meekneſs inſtructing thoſe that oppoſe, if God give them to — recover out of the Snare of the Devil,</hi> &amp;c. 2 Tim. 2. <hi>ult.</hi> Not to reſign them up to the Devil, and then abſolve for Money.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Some alſo fear, the Sacrament you offer is not Chriſt's Supper, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.20. (Name or Thing); for as that Name is alien to Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſo is the Thing: Chriſt does not bleſs it. To ſome that went of late it prov'd a Sop. Your Miniſters have no true Call to conſecrate or bleſs the Elements. And,</p>
            <p n="4">4. They find you not in a Table-Geſture, but kneeling to, or at the Rails; and ſo you ſymbolize (at leaſt) with Roman Idolatry, in which they are not to participate with you.
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:151110:133"/>The Papiſts ſay, the Body of Chriſt tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiates the Bread, (Lutherans, it conſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiates) and ſo may well adore it; you ſay neither, and yet kneel to 't, as to God: Well may they ſeparate.</p>
            <p n="5">5. They find you own another Headſhip than Chriſt's, giving what you well took from the Pope, to Man, which is not competible or due to any Mortal, ſave Chriſt only.</p>
            <p n="6">6. They liſp out, (as they dare) that you look too luſcious, or aſquint to the old Mother. Some Sons of the Church plead for a Peace with <hi>Rome;</hi> Rites are a ſure Sign. — I could urge <hi>Martial:</hi>
               <q>

               </lg>
            </q>
            <p>Truly a Voice all Curſes, is like Hell, not the Church of Chriſt; ſo that one may ſay,</p>
            <q>
               <l>Were the Pope's Bull, and P—Curſe,</l>
               <l>As ſharp in Conſcience as the Purſe;</l>
               <l>Both high and low in this our Nation,</l>

            <pb n="242" facs="tcp:151110:134"/>
            <p n="7">7. But laſtly, I ſay for them, they cannot in Conſcience come and receive, you have ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Additions to God's Word, (<hi>Prov.</hi> 30.6.) your Poſts by God's, (<hi>Ezek.</hi> 43.8.) that it alters the thing to which the Addition is put; as Civilians ſay, — <hi>Additamentum rei naturam tollit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now I would only ask from that Text, (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.28. <hi>cum ſequent.</hi>) <hi>Let a Man examine himſelf, and ſo eat,</hi> (with what follows) Did the Apoſtle concern or intend us? You ſay, Yea: Then is each worthy Receiver to mind, that the Church which he receives with (as one Bread) be after the Apoſtolick, not Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtatick Patern, as well as his perſonal Fitneſs. And I ask alſo, Does the Apoſtle write to the Paſtors, or the People? (or rather both?) Sure all will yield, to both: Then I ſay, the delivering of ſo ſacred Symbols by or into un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waſhen hands, that nor can, nor do examine their own Fitneſs, (nor do the Prieſts help them) is to profane the thing, to take God's Name in vain, and to be your ſelves acceſſary to the Receivers Guilt and Ruine; a Charge as heavy to anſwer to Chriſt, as lightly aſſumed of late, in a futilous, vain, and pernicious Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet, printed. (<hi>Child</hi>'s <hi>2d Argument, p.</hi> 3.</p>
            <p n="6">
               <hi>6thly,</hi> Not forgetting the Office of an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>former, to them I only ſay three things:
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:151110:134"/>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Touching your Race.</item>
                  <item>2. Courſe.</item>
                  <item>3. Concluſion.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt; For your Riſe and Race. It may be derived high: <hi>Cain</hi> is the Root of your Blood, Envy the Root of your Actings, the Devil Father to both; Envy the Source, Ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice the Channel it runs in; that breeds the Act, this feeds the Agent. Trace it along from the beginning. Firſt, the Devil accuſes God to <hi>Evah,</hi> then he propagates his Seed by <hi>Cain,</hi> in killing <hi>Abel;</hi> next, by the Giants Race; after, by <hi>Tubal-Cain,</hi> and all the Pipers and Muſicians; who being all immers'd in the Flood, (<hi>Job</hi> 22.16.) <hi>Nimrod</hi> is next of that Stock, a mighty Hunter, (<hi>Gen.</hi> 10.9.) and do we think he wanted theſe Beagles, and Setters of the Game? <hi>As</hi> Nimrod, <hi>a mighty Hunter before the Lord:</hi> A Rebel, as his Name denotes. Theſe may lie in the ſame Houſe, as <hi>Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Iſhmael;</hi> in the ſame Womb, as <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau:</hi> and yet the one perſecute the other, and that for God's ſake. Go on to <hi>Eſau</hi>'s Dukes, all a Race of cruel Haters to <hi>Iſrael:</hi> And ſo <hi>Amalek</hi> bears up the Name; witneſs his dogging the feeble among them in the Rear, (<hi>Exod.</hi> 17. <hi>ult.</hi>) And of that Stock was <hi>Agag;</hi> how high his Kingly Throne was, let <hi>Balaam</hi> ſay, (<hi>Numb.</hi> 24.7.) <hi>Doeg</hi> comes in next, a Maſquerade Worſhipper; he was before the Lord indeed, but detain'd, hid, <hi>(incluſerat ſe in Tabernaculo)</hi> not of good-will to Devotion,
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:151110:135"/>but (as you come to our Meetings) to ſerve a Job for the Devil; nor yet for <hi>Saul,</hi> ſo much as Self; and being his Herdſman, (if you will, Butcher) learn'd to be bloody, <hi>Nob,</hi> a whole City, Women, Infants, (with 85 Prieſts of the Lord) he kill'd and ruin'd, (1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 22.18, 19.) <hi>Joſephus</hi> ſays, he razed and burnt it, and killed 385 Perſons. And (which was ſad) tho <hi>Saul</hi> was anointed of God, yet being annoy'd with that evil Spirit, he by comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it owns the Guilt, tho his Footmen de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd Obedience to that Command, but this Dog obeyed quickly; which (they or he) were better Subjects, let Senſe judg. <hi>Rabbins</hi> ſay, after he was that Armour-bearer, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too near <hi>Saul</hi>'s Perſon, found a Seaſon to kill him, after the Battel. Others call him a Paſtor to <hi>Saul</hi>'s Flocks; and ſome alſo a Judg, (Dr. <hi>Mayor</hi>) but commiſſion'd now for this Job, as a chief of <hi>Saul</hi>'s Servants. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.9. His Succeſſor is <hi>Haman</hi> the <hi>Agagite,</hi> that ſtruck (in <hi>Eſther</hi>) at all the Race of <hi>Iſrael, Eſth.</hi> 3.8. And the Line runs to <hi>Herod,</hi> who ſlew 14000 Infants for Chriſt. Nay, to <hi>Judas,</hi> of whom (<hi>Mayor</hi> ſays, <hi>Vol.</hi> 2. <hi>p.</hi> 316.) <hi>Doeg</hi> was a Type; ſo all are, that intend Envy under the Mask of Piety.</p>
            <p>To end this of the Riſe of them, I remind my Reader, that ſome eight Years ſince, (<hi>Anno</hi> 1675.) there came a ſtitcht Book to hand, ſtil'd, <hi>A Rebuke to our Informers;</hi> in which the ſober Author, after the Perface, firſt convicts
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:151110:135"/>them of their Sin; ſecondly, anſwers Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; thirdly, makes ſome Inferences: in all, handles the Matter ſo gravely, truly, and ſtre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuouſly, that I judg that Piece (of 84 Pages) not only meet for a vicious Informer, but any rigid Prieſt; or Perſon, that loves ſober Truth. But to follow my purpoſe, I ſay, it is no ſhame to us, to ſuffer what Chriſt our Lord did; nor any credit to our Accuſers, to do what <hi>Judas</hi> did, the Top of all whoſe Kin is the Devil.</p>
            <p>Secondly; For the Courſe you run, 'tis pernicious and vile, and that,</p>
            <p n="1">1. To the King. It is ſo far from ſerving his Intereſt, that it looſens the Bands of Union, and tempts the People to a Jealouſy, as if he meant to reſign the Rule and Reins of a Prince to ſuch petty Tyrants. You diminiſh the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and diſcourage the Trade of the Sedulous, and ſo can never countervail the King's Damage, <hi>Eſth.</hi> 7.4. (as <hi>Haman</hi> pretends, <hi>Eſther</hi> denies.) If <hi>Solomon</hi> reaſon right, <hi>Prov.</hi> 20.38. <hi>By Mercy and Truth is the King preſerv'd; his Throne is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held by Mercy,</hi> Mercy ſhew'd the Poor, (<hi>Dan.</hi> 4.27.) Truth preach'd to the Erring, ſo his Perſon or Power is upheld: Then Cruelty, Exactions, and Falſhood in Oaths, weaken both. You hurt him by his own Weapon, in pretending Law.</p>
            <p n="2">2. You injure Proteſtants, in weakning them by Fines, deterring them from their Religious Duties, and the Exerciſe of their Gifts and Graces, for others Good. You propagate the
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:151110:136"/>Plot, and ſerve the Papiſts, in turning the Force of Laws, in the harſheſt Sence, to the diſquiet of the Peaceable in the Land, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 55.20.) And ſo Proteſtants are ſet to vex each other, Papiſts in the Interim divide all, <hi>(Divide &amp; Impera)</hi> to ſerve your Rapine.</p>
            <p n="3">3. You accuſe Men that are innocent, falſly, as if Rebels to the King, for obeying God's Command; of Hereticks in the Church, for ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hering to Truth; or ſeditious and factious to the State, while you by Slanders are the Seedſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of thoſe Tares; Schiſmaticks, for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding from <hi>Babel,</hi> when our Biſhop's Plea was, <hi>No Peace with</hi> Rome. (Biſhop <hi>Hall.</hi>) Nor know you Zealots well (that ſo purſue our Conventicles) what to define them. If <hi>Minſhew</hi>'s Word may paſs, (in the ill Sence) a Conventicle is, <hi>Conventus ſeditioſorum &amp; ſce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leratorum,</hi> a Meeting of ſeditious and wicked Men. If Biſhop <hi>Bridgman</hi>'s be right (reported to me) 'tis a little Meeting of Men, out of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Precincts, to conſult on State-Affairs, and the Doors ſhut for Secrecy: Ours are not ſuch.</p>
            <p n="4">4. How many Towns, Cities, Families, are endanger'd by you? Some impriſon'd, or beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger'd; ſome forc'd out; pious Miniſters expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to flee from their Families, to eſcape your Raven, (for 100 <hi>l.</hi> Fine) and ſober Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men hector'd by you, that would not vex their honeſt Neighbours, Tenants, and Friends; and Officers of Peace, and whole Towns
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:151110:136"/>fermented, divided, and perturbed.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Lo what Guilt you incur, by afflicting the Juſt, offending Chriſt's little Ones, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in him; prohibiting the publication of the Word of Life; profaning the Sabbath your ſelves, by hindring others; coveting to take the Spoil and Goods of the Poor; taking Oaths, and telling Lies and Tales for Gain; ſmiting Fellow-ſervants (<hi>Mat.</hi> 24.49.) and Subjects by the Tongue; ſerving the Devil, in caſting Men in Priſon. <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.10.</p>
            <p n="6">6. This has been the Sin, and has brought Miſery on the Heads of others, (<hi>Marſhal</hi> and <hi>Stroud</hi> in <hi>London</hi> of late) you took no war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; Obſtinacy and Obduration is now agge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated on your Guilt; you approach the Sin un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Death, (1 <hi>John</hi> 5.16.) that is not to be forgiven. You dread not the Marks of <hi>Cain, Doeg, Judas:</hi> Beware you feel not the Horror of a deſpairing Conſcience like <hi>Spira, Latomus, Eccebolus,</hi> (that ſaid, <hi>Calcate me ſalem inſipidum</hi>) <hi>Porphyry,</hi> &amp;c. That's a Worm immortal.</p>

            <p>Thirdly; Look to the End of your Courſe: What is it but Hatred of God and Man? Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps they that employ you, may deſert you to the Juſtice of the Vulgar, and give you a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>primand, like that the Council and Prieſts gave <hi>Judas,</hi> (Mat. 27.34.) <hi>What's that to us? ſee thou to that.</hi> So will the Wages of Unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs (2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.15.) melt in your Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and make Hell-Fire ſparkle and flaſh in your Eyes, and be too hot to hold.

            <p>Now to put you all together, I beſeech you for Lenity: Put on Spectacles; the Night is dark, you ſoon may run on the dark Mountains, and repent too late.

As (therefore) you love God, pity Religion, tender the Weal of Princes or People, favour a woful, ſinning, ſinking Kingdom, and the Glory of your new built Church and City; go not on the Pikes of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ril, ride not o're your own Fields and Franchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, to your undoing; drive not your Head (as if you were blind) to precipitant Courſes.

            <p>But next I addreſs my Supplication to this City, and thoſe that rule it, and crave of them what God commands unto the Princes of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> in a Viſion relating to our Goſpel-Times, and

            <p n="1">1. The Portion of Rulers was on the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide of the holy Portion, to ſhew that Rulers ought to defend and hedg in all the Parts of Worſhip, and not invade it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That the Lot or Portion that People have in Religious Matters, is an Inheritance of God's Donation, not Man's, (as <hi>Naboth</hi>'s Vineyard) not to be alienated at the pleaſure of Man. This made <hi>David</hi>'s Complaint and Curſe ſo juſt, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.29. <hi>If the Sons of Men, — curſed be they of the Lord; for they have driven me out from the Lord's Inheritance,</hi> i.e. the Holy Land, and God's Tabernacle: So 'twas a double Wrong.</p>
            <p>Now this we ask of your city, and plead our Right to, as juſtly as you plead for your Charter: That only ſecures your Civil Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſes to you; this ſecures our God, Faith and Salvation to us: That was yours by Cuſtom, immemorial, free, long Preſcription; this is ours by divine and unforfeitable Gift, that none ought to tkae.

I confeſs, I ſee many of thoſe at the Helm inclined to Lenity; they mind how infamouſly ſome have gone off the Stage for their Severity; they find it hard to perſecute for Conſcience ſake; they remember ſome Men (now ſtruck at) to have been twenty or forty Years Miniſters, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Citizens in <hi>London,</hi> of Note, one for Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the other for Trade. They ſee it a Work not eaſy, to cruſh thoſe that have grown by Oppoſition, as Camomel. And that the lower Officers of Peace (ſome of them) decline Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor, and rather run the hazard of Fines, Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonments, or what Fury impoſes on them, than to impoſe Exactions of Law on thoſe that love the Goſpel, or ſtarve the Poor, to feed their Raven that hate both, (for ruine the rich <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naticks,</hi> and you pine the Poor, that you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not feed your ſevles alone) and help us all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Nooze of Popery. And all may ſee the Matter is impracticable. The People ſtudy ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Shifts, (and cleave the Hair) not ruffling with the Conſtables, to provoke, on one hand; nor deſerting their Duty to God and Souls on the other; but change their Times, the Day for the Night, (as <hi>Caligula</hi>'s Decree once for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced <hi>Rome</hi> to do, inverting the Works of Day
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:151110:140"/>and Night acroſs) and one Hour, Place, or Preacher for another; that ſo Diſturbance and Informers are much prevented, and God's Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip is preſerv'd.

            <p>Alſo the Opinion of many jumps with the Votes of the late Commons, as to this, and obtains vaſt Merit and Veneration; that Houſe (in ſome Paſſages, and in that Vote) being deeply prophetick, and very plain in the event, namely, That to proſecute the Penal Laws now, is noxious to the King, publick Peace, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Religion, and promotes the Plot for Popery. This all that will not ſee, may feel. What ill Work had followed ſince! what wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and lawleſs Spoils and Expilations! what Executions, like <hi>Bonner!</hi> what ragged Coats, empty Purſes, abhorr'd Names, hard Priſons, their Dilapidations on others has well awarded them in this Life! And what is like to follow in the other Life, (if Repentance be abhorr'd) let <hi>Judas</hi> tell them, in what he ſaid ere he went to his place. <hi>Mat.</hi> 27.3. <hi>Acts</hi> 1.16, 25. And

O then take advice from that wiſe <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maliel,</hi> (<hi>Acts</hi> 5.38.) for your Peace, and the City's Good; and let Counſels of Lenity obtain.</p>
            <p>But on the other hand, where Moderation is branded, and Men are both warranted and willing to act, lo what Work they do! What tearing of carv'd Work, ſcattering of pious Aſſemblies! what Breaking of Doors and Dwellings! what Diſtreſs on Goods! what vaſt Fines on Eſtates, by which ſome are quite cruſh'd! What ſnapping Men up by one Law, and puniſhing them by another, to perpetuate their Priſons! What harſh Taunts, and hard Speeches are given, to make the Afflicted more loaden! If a Smith, Bayliff, Buck, come but to the Arreſt, or a Sir <hi>John</hi> — what Door, Wall, or Shelter, ſtands againſt the Hammer and Staff of the one, or the Horns of the other?

            <p>But ſince we find Rigor is limited, not exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted on all to Extremity, and in all places: Some Showers have fallen by Planets, here and not there; ſome (not all) catch'd and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd; Places that had but one or two Meetings earſt, have three or four now; the more nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Lectures ſcatter'd, out of one Ward into another. And ſo you have a Go-by, no Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; and we a Retreat, no Rout; and for one Aſſembly of many hundreds routed, you make them four or five in Houſes by Scores, and ſo multiply them you diſperſe; and that argues the Work impracticable.

            <p>So I paſs from the firſt part of our Advice. It reſts to give Counſel to the Friends of Holy Worſhip, to guide them in their Duties, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it is oppoſed or no.</p>
            <p>If God preſerve you in Peace, and give you reſt in your Duty, and you can (in a time of Diſtreſs) wait on him without outward Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraction, no roaring Lions or Bears tear in up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you, your Officers are Peace, and Exactors Juſtice, (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 60.17.) know 'tis a peculiar Caſe, an over-ruling hand of Providence. O where is your Lot caſt? Are you in an <hi>Egyptian</hi> World? Are you in the midſt of <hi>Meſheck,</hi> (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 120.5.) and yet enjoy a <hi>Goſhen</hi> of Light, (<hi>Exod.</hi> 10.23.) a Valley of Viſion? (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 22.1.) O ſee what diſtinguiſhing Favour you have, and what pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Duty it calls for upon it. Think not your Worth greater than your Brethrens. In general Calamities often the beſt fall, and go captive firſt, as did <hi>Jeremiah</hi>'s Basket of beſt Figs, (<hi>Jer.</hi> 24.5, 6.) and theſe the Lord pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to acknowledg, and ſhall not you own them? Your Fleſh is as the Fleſh of your Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, (<hi>Nehem.</hi> 5.5.) and Sympathy argues living Memberſhip; that Member is dead, that
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:151110:143"/>feels nothing of the Body's Pain and Dolour. Lay your Ears to the Key-holes of ſome Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſets, and (in ſome Recluſes) you may hear Complaints: Lord, why am I the firſt the Boar is let looſe on? What is the cauſe of let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting looſe the Reins to afflict us? (<hi>Job</hi> 30.11.) And being pick'd out of the Herd, that now all the Flock puſh at us, and thruſt with the Horn? Time was when we had place for our Brethrens Souls, as our own; and then we thought it a Duty to ſtand or fall all together; but the ſame Mind is not in all alike: Some are jealous our Teſtimony or Spirit is too tart, our Talk too loud, and receive us not, as Chriſt has (freely) to the Glory of God. (<hi>Rom.</hi> 15.7.) Chriſt forbad not others, (<hi>Mark</hi> 9.39.) tho not following him. Why we are look'd ſhie on, and Brethren ſhould do that to us, that our Enemies have done to ſome, and would do to us all, we know not. Are they Miniſters? ſo are we; (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.23.) do Souls flock (in love to Chriſt) after them? ours have the ſame Love.</p>
            <p>Surely the Carriage of ſome to each other is moroſe, ſupercilious, unkind, and very partial. To crave an Hours Room or two for Chriſt's ſake, and neither Petition nor Petitioner to have acceſs, is hard; tho the ſame is granted to others: Of this I'm glad, yet ſee no cauſe for the other. Some have more cauſe to mourn than others; to be denied the Uſe of Places ſix or eight times over in publick, now when
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:151110:143"/>Houſes are ſo hard to gain, ſo inconvenient, and ſo hazardous.</p>
            <p>Conſider, it is for Chriſt's ſake that you have more Room, better Places, civiller Officers, longer Quiet than others; and perhaps the Lord ſays, you ſhall not fare worſe, or fall ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner (in the leaſt) for your kindneſs to any for his ſake. Or however, if you do, it ſhall turn to you for a Teſtimony, and Chriſt will award the Blow of Fury from you, or reward your Loſs the more.</p>
            <p>Conſider what Argument God urges on <hi>Moab,</hi> to receive and hide God's Outcaſts by, (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 16.4, 5.) <hi>For Extortioners ceaſe, and the Spoiler is at an end, and Oppreſſors are conſum'd out of the Land; and in Mercy the Throne ſhall be eſtabliſh'd:</hi> A bleſſed Sight even to a <hi>Moabite,</hi> far better to an <hi>Iſraelite;</hi> and to us that Duty is more binding, that Motive being the Spring of all our Courage and Comforts.</p>
            <p>Conſider how ſad 'tis to offend one of Chriſt's little Ones that believe in him, or add Grief to the Wounded; bruiſe a cruſh'd Reed, and quench ſmoaking Flax; or put under a Bed or Buthel, a Light of Chriſt's ſetting up. It's ſad enough that Men ſilence a Prophet; far ſadder, that Saints keep them ſo, and bind a Neceſſity of continuing ſo ſcatter'd, two or three Months together.</p>
            <p>Conſider, your hir'd Houſes, like <hi>Paul</hi>'s at <hi>Rome, Acts</hi> 28.30. (a Priſoner) are for Chriſt's ſake yours; and is't not his Praiſe in the Goſpel,
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:151110:144"/>(and ſo were it yours) to receive all that come to him? And if you argue, that your Place is the Tenure of ſuch and ſuch, and 'tis not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable to hazard your own Peace and Liberty, to gratify others; (This ſavours of a narrow private Spirit.) I grant, yet Religion is a Peg higher than Reaſon; and Charity in ſuffering Times is above Self-property. God forbid any ſhould tread your Places or Threſholds to your detriment; yet if one comes to you for Chriſt's ſake, and a Petition is denied by you for an hour, or once a month; Does it not ſavour of ſelf, ſo to argue? And is it not to help to gratify the Adverſary, weaken the ſame Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, make the Travels eaſier in ſuppreſſing you, and rejoyce the Men that ſeek our Hurt? For ſay they, they grow ſhie of one another, let us alone with the reſt.</p>
            <p>Conſider, laſtly, the legal Care that God ſhew'd of his <hi>Levites</hi> of old, in caſe of Exile, (Deut. 18.6, 7.) <hi>If a Levite came, with all the deſire of his Mind, to the Place that God chuſes, he muſt miniſter as his Brethren do, before the Lord, and eat of the ſame Portions.</hi> Now if ſome Things were Levitical, and ſo bind us not to Perſons, Orders, Race or Place; yet 'tis of moral and perpetual Obligation, to keep up the Freedom of Prophecy, (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.24.) with the Sons of the Prophets; and for them to ſay, if you have a Word of Exhortation, ſay on, (<hi>Acts</hi> 13.15.) and not to ingroſs Office, Place, and Profits to one. Chriſt ſent out by two, Paſtors
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:151110:144"/>and Teachers. <hi>Mark</hi> 6.7. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.11.</p>
            <p>Let it not then ſuffice us to have our own Peace and Liberty, without our Brethren and Companions. For my own part, I wiſh my ſelf the only ſilenc'd Preacher in the Land; not that I'm weary of my Maſter's Work, (which I would purchaſe with the greateſt Fine) but 'cauſe I wiſh all Men better, and had more Liberty and Succeſs than I. Nor complain I for ſelf, tho 'tis ſad to have (as Mr. <hi>S. R.</hi> ſaid) but one Eye, and that to be put out, but 'tis want of a publick Spirit; yet am I not offended at any: 'Tis ſad tho to have Hundreds ſcatter'd, and none to ſay, Come and help us.</p>
            <p>All I add is, Thoſe that have preſent Reſt, uſe it, as they did, <hi>Acts</hi> 9.31. <hi>walking in the Fear of the Lord, and in the Comforts of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, were ſo multiplied.</hi> Then ſays the Text, v. 27. <hi>had they Reſt,</hi> (i.e.) when <hi>Paul</hi> was converted. The remoter Context it may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect: but the nearer relates to the Care and Boldneſs of the Brethren for <hi>Paul,</hi> who were not ſhie or afraid of his bold Teſtimony (then to his hazard) and then had they Reſt; which notes, God's time to give Reſt to his People, is, when they are boldeſt in their Teſtimony, and tendereſt of their Care of one another.</p>
            <p>Further, O how thankful ſhould you be, that God has diſtinguiſh'd you from others! Plac'd you in a Valley of Viſion, others in a Land of Darkneſs! You have the joyful Sound;
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:151110:145"/>other hear little but roaring in the Sanctuary, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 74.3.) You hear and ſee your Teachers, (as the Promiſe is, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 30.20.) others are driven into Corners, and get neither. You have the Word in Plenty, (more than ever you had); the Loſs many ſuffer, is your Gain; O make it not turn to your Judgment, and ſadder Account! Your Places are open ſtill, by the over-ruling Providence of God; how many are in Fields, in ſolitary Woods, in Mountains and Deſerts, in Dens and Caves of the Earth! <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.38. O bleſs that God, whoſe Eye and Wing is your ſafe Defence.</p>
            <p>Secondly; To the Friends of Worſhip, I give a twofold Advice,
<list>
                  <item>1. Negative.</item>
                  <item>2. Poſitive.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>In the Negative, four ways:</p>
            <p n="1">1. Let none that love God's Worſhip, and would ſee his glorious Defence of it, (to make it good in ſight of all) ſtand indifferent, or halt in bivious Thoughts about it. Such is the unſtable Mind of many of the better ſort, would God ſhew his Power for them preſently, and (as <hi>Bildad</hi> promis'd <hi>Job,</hi> chap. 8. v. 6.) now awake for them, they would adhere to his Altar: But let the Clouds gather thick and black, the Altars of God be dug down, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets be ſlain, and drove into Holes and Caves, <hi>Ahab</hi> threaten the reſt, and put the boldeſt <hi>Elijahs</hi> to flight, and let <hi>Iſrael</hi> be put under
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:151110:145"/>
               <hi>Philiſtines</hi> Yoke; now profeſt <hi>Iſraelites</hi> begin to limp, and halt on one or both Hams, <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bobus poplitibus claudicare.</hi> This the Prophet chides <hi>Iſrael</hi> for, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 18.21. and ſo does <hi>Hoſea,</hi> by another Simile, (<hi>Hoſ.</hi> 7.8.) <hi>As a Cake not turn'd,</hi> that neither is good Bread, nor Dough, wants the other Turn, half-roaſt, half-raw; or as Chriſt told <hi>Laodicea, Neither hot nor cold,</hi> Rev. 3.15. much indifferent what Side is upmoſt; make ſure, not of the better ſide, (which Chriſt takes) but of the bigger, and ſo change (as Vanes, under the Croſs) as the Wind of Providence blows. Are the Arrians ſet in the Imperial Chair? now the World (as once) wonders, it's turned Arrian; if the Orthodox be upmoſt, all are ſo now. Moſt Chriſtians are nominally ſo only, and for Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt change Profeſſions, as the Camelion does Colours. Such was <hi>Eccebolus,</hi> four times in the Revolution of the Publick Affairs he chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, till (at laſt) convict for his Levity, he comes to the Aſſembly, and falls down before them, crying, <hi>Calcate me ſalem inſipidum,</hi> Tread on me as inſipid Salt. <hi>(Euſeb.)</hi> A flexible Mind to Entreaties is very good; but in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience and Religion, now 'tis bad; to be (as a great State-Politician once was) not ſtiff as the Oak, but a pliant Willow, flexible to any thing. O be as the <hi>Antiarians,</hi> that admitted not a Word or a Letter in their Creed; or as ſtout <hi>Baſil,</hi> that would not alter a word to the Prefect, tho to eſcape all Torments and Death.
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:151110:146"/>So <hi>Petrus Mungus,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> turned four times to and againſt. O how, often hath <hi>England</hi> ſo done? The very two Eyes, what Duſt has blown into them by our Mutations? Alas! Men are like <hi>Plato,</hi> know much of God, but dare not own it for fear of the People. Or, as <hi>Lactantius</hi> (<hi>de Orig. Error. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 3.) charges <hi>Tull. Cicero,</hi> He durſt not undertake the Patronage of Truth, for fear of <hi>Socrates</hi>'s Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: Socratis <hi>carcerem times, ideo veritatis pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trocinium Suſcipere non audes.</hi> This leads to a ſecond Caution.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Let all that love the Lamb, caſt out Fear; true and perfect Love does ſo, (1 <hi>John</hi> 4.18.) and 'tis a fearful Snare, that Fear of Man brings, (<hi>Prov.</hi> 29.25.) Theſe ſtand in the Front of the black Roll; why? becauſe that lets in to any Evil of Sin. Give me a timorous, white-liver'd Man, I'll make a ſuperſtitious Man, next an Idolatrous of him; and the covetous Man is ſo, that ever fears the Loſs of his Mammon. And beſide, ſuch will flip, wave, permute, and omit Duty (upon danger) at any how, or clip, halt, pick and chuſe, or halve his Obedience; as <hi>Saul</hi> in fear of the People, he obeyed them, not God, (1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.24.) The Prince obeys the People, note that, a ſad Saying! This he fear'd not, when the eighty five Prieſts, and <hi>Nob</hi> were put to the Sword. O what a Cow-Heart, what a Mouſe and Snail Fear makes a Man, or a Chriſtian! As one ſaid,
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:151110:146"/>
               <q>
                  <lg>
                     <l>
                        <hi>In pace Leones, in praelio Cervi:</hi>
                     </l>
                  </lg>
                  <lg>
                     <l>In Peace as Lions they appear,</l>
                     <l>In War (as Harts) they flie for fear.</l>
                  </lg>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>How boldly ſome talk, when no danger is? But let the Winds riſe, and now all's mute. As Frogs in the ſtill Night, how do they croak? Throw in a Log, or light a Torch, all's whiſt. Does God defend, and do we fear? Is not one God, Captain, Army, Weapon, Shield, and Fort, enough for thee and I? (as <hi>Antigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> ſaid to a fearful Souldier) How many rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon we one God for? To cure ſinful Fear, conſider,</p>
            <p n="1">1. God has forbid it often in ſome Texts, (four or five times) <hi>Iſa.</hi> 41.20, 14. <hi>Luke</hi> 12.47. and that makes it a Sin: As <hi>Nehemiah</hi> ſaid, (<hi>Nehem.</hi> 6.13.) when tempted to a Sanctuary in the Temple, <hi>That I ſhould do ſo, and ſin.</hi> And that weakens us, and offends God, that is to defend us.</p>
            <p n="2">2. 'Tis an Argument of little Faith, and that Grace out of exerciſe is as no Faith. Why did ye fear, ſaid Chriſt to the Diſciples, <hi>O ye of little Faith!</hi> (Mat. 8.26.) But in <hi>Mark</hi> it's expreſs'd ſharper, (<hi>Mark</hi> 4.40.) <hi>How is it you have no Faith? (q.d.)</hi> What! go to Sea with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Tackle, or heave it over board as uſeleſs, when you need it moſt? At what time you be afraid, now to truſt becomes us. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 56.3.</p>
            <pb n="268" facs="tcp:151110:147"/>
            <p n="3">3. Fear unfits for any Warfare; (literally) Such <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were ſent back, that fear'd to face, (<hi>Deut.</hi> 20.3, 4, 7, 8.) leſt they ſhould make their Brethrens Hearts faint, like their own: And it's worſe in the Chriſtian Warfare. See, O you Females, and follow the Patern of your Mother <hi>Sarah,</hi> (1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.6, 14.) that was not afraid of any Amazement. So after, <hi>Fear not their Fear, nor be afraid.</hi> What Hurries are ſome of that Sex in now! and how diſhonou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to our Duty, our God, Goſpel, Hope, and Chriſtianity! yea, before the Adverſary will it not reproach us? The Coward had bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſtay away.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Miniſters are peculiarly forbid to fear, for they work the Work of the Lord; and <hi>Paul</hi> gives it in charge to <hi>Corinth,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.10. (as they being firſt concern'd) that <hi>Timothy</hi> be with them without fear, ſince without danger and oppoſition he could not be. It means either, 1. That he muſt be (as in them lay) ſecur'd by a prudent Care to prevent his Peril, (if that were poſſible,) yet that's the leaſt that is in it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That none ought among them to put him in fear, by provoking the Lord to departure. Or, 3. (and chiefly) that his Faith and Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage was to riſe, as his Oppoſition did; being at God's Work, no Oppoſition was to daſh him out of face: The ſame Vigor was to be in him, that Chriſt put in <hi>Paul, Acts</hi> 18.9. (by a Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) at the firſt planting of the Goſpel there; and having Chriſt's preſence with him, he was
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:151110:147"/>to admit no Argument, Sign or Degree of ſinful Fear, ſince it was God's Work he had in hand. <hi>Nil terribile niſi ipſe timor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now here ariſes the honeſt Jealouſy of my Soul, as fearing our Policy outvies our Piety, and Zeal for God and Truth. And tho I grudg no Mans Eſcape from Treachery, yet I commend the moſt noble and bold Witneſs in any, (tho I attain not to it my ſelf, O that I could!) Not to eſcape my ſelf, if the Maſter be in Jeopardy, is to me pleaſing. Life and Livelihood are ſweet, and the Fleſh is ſoon ſenſible of what gratifies it with eaſe; but I cannot attain that, not to accept a Deliverance, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.35. Had I but the clear view of Mr. <hi>Abr. Chear</hi>'s better Reſurrection; then what Joy would a Priſon or Death be for the Word and Soul's ſake? Says he, <hi>p.</hi> 4. <q rend="inline">If Deliverance may not be had, but on Terms diſhonourable to the Lord, now 'tis a Snare; to accept it, is a Sin, and a Ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh to Faith.</q> And after, in a Letter for aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling in time of hazard, he ſays, <hi>p.</hi> 250. Where is the Lord God of <hi>Elijah?</hi> I was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh'd with <hi>Burroughs</hi> urging that of <hi>Luther,</hi> 
               <q rend="inline">I deſire to be faithful: If I cannot be a prudent Miniſter, ſtanding in the Gap is more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous than being behind the Hedg; one may be more ſecure under the Wind: But it's beſt to be where God looks to find us, and there may we hope to ſee him.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. Eye ſome Perſons more ſet by Chriſt in the Front of this Battel, than others. While ſome
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:151110:148"/>of greateſt note are laid in a Corner, by Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of Body, Age, or Spirit, or ſome ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming Steps of Decay in wonted Zeal; or 'cauſe their Parts might cloud his Glory; or elſe the Brunt of the Battel, or the Heat of the Sun, has beat hardeſt (as on <hi>Jonah</hi>'s Head) and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them to flie to ſome empty withering Gourd for a Shelter: Or whatever 'tis, theſe (at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent) retire. In the mean while, Chriſt pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently culls out (it may be) ſome mean, little-notic'd, poor, and young <hi>David,</hi> ſome from the Flocks, (or ſo) to confound the wiſe, learned Doctors, and mighty. And theſe weak Worms lie at the Root of the old Oak of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhan,</hi> and gnaw out its Life; as once the Mice raiſed the <hi>Perſian</hi> Siege, by cating of their Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrings: And all to teach us that are of note, and were in Chriſt before, (<hi>Rom.</hi> 16.7.) to ſtir up our Gift and Grace, that it die not; <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.6. as the Prieſts did the holy Fire, that was on God's Altar.</p>
            <p>O ye Fathers and Brethren, how ſhould you cry, as <hi>Aphraates,</hi> for the ſcatter'd Flock that bleat in the Deſert for Solitude, while you ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence your Gifts, and offend Chriſt's little Ones, by your turnings to an Harlot's Houſe, and conſulting Fleſh and Self in your Latitudes.</p>
            <p n="6">6. To cure Fear in our Duty, ſee the Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Lord's People here at <hi>Mizpeh:</hi> Had the Prophet been like us, he had neither pray'd for them, nor atoned by the Sucking-Lamb, but left them to a Flight, or Captivity to the
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:151110:148"/>rude Army of the <hi>Philiſtines;</hi> but now doing his Duty, God honours it, him, and them, with both a Defence; and Defeat of the Enemy. The like is in <hi>Ezra,</hi> (<hi>Ezra</hi> 3.3.) They ſet up the Altar, (for Fear was on them, for the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of thoſe Countries) that is, leſt they ſhould ſurprize them, ere they had done their Duty to God firſt: (So <hi>Jackson in loc.</hi>) And it was without doors, the Houſe not yet founded, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they had the old Baſis to ſet it on. Sight of Danger edg'd their Senſe of Duty. As <hi>Caius Fabius,</hi> that brake through an Hoſt, to offer an Yearly Sacrifice, <hi>(ſatis ſperans propitios fore Deos, quorum cultum, &amp;c.)</hi> hoping the Gods would be propitious, whoſe Worſhip the Fear of (even) Death could not prohibit or inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit. And ſhall a Heathens Zeal exceed the Chriſtians, to a true God, and his pure Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip?</p>
            <p n="7">7. Conſider, of what or whom are you afraid? What, a Priſon? That's not ſo bad as the Fear is: And why? The Comforts pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponderate the Croſs. <hi>David</hi> and you ſhould join to one Petition, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 142.7. (i.e.) <hi>Bring my Soul out of Priſon:</hi> That's a far worſe Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. To be under fear to a Worm, that's ſad. I knew a good Woman in fear of Spiders, that ſhut her Eyes Years together. Art afraid of a venemous Spider? ſet the Foot of Faith on it, and cruſh it. <hi>Who art thou,</hi> (ſaid God) <hi>to fear a Man that ſhall die?</hi> Iſa. 51.12. Who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed? Sure not a Saint; what ſhall I call thee?
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:151110:149"/>
               <hi>My Righteous are as bold as a Lion.</hi> Prov. 28. 1. Doſt' call me a God? Is not Man a Worm, and ſhortly to die? and then where is he? And for thee to fear him, how unreaſonable is it? Alas! he's but a ſmoa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Brand, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 7.2, 4. Are there two of them? what of that? Both ſhortly ſhall be extinct, tho confederate together. See how God allays the needleſs Fear of his, in a like time. The Atheiſt ſays, <hi>Primus in orbe Deos fecit timor:</hi> Fear firſt made Gods in the Earth. But the true God was before them, and thy Fear makes more Gods, and ſo adoreſt them of thy own creating. Let me predicate. In a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle while none ſhall cauſe Terror, the terrible one comes to nought, the Scorner ceaſes, and God will cauſe his Terror on them. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 32. <hi>ult. Iſa.</hi> 16.4. Then no Feller, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 14.8. nor Treader, nor Milker, (as the Hebrew ſtiles Oppreſſors) ſhall be on Earth; no Name, or Place, Son or Nephew left. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.8.</p>
            <p>I Confeſs, ſome Men make themſelves ſore Terrors to others; yet ſee the Caſe as 'tis, and put it at worſt: Why ſhould Chriſtians fear? Alas! Some with-hold Corn, that's ſad lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, People ſhall curſe them, Nations abhor them; what Curſe is due for detaining Soul-Food? Chriſtians are a Terror each to other. Well, a <hi>Barbarian Mahometan</hi> is on's way to pay <hi>Rome, Italy, Germany</hi> off in their own Coin. Is <hi>Hungary</hi> loſt by Roman Cruelty? and ſhall any write by that Copy among Proteſtants?
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:151110:149"/>
               <hi>Spain</hi>'s Tyranous Inquiſition, created the 17 <hi>Holland</hi>-Provinces Republick: So ſhelter there was prepared, for a Refuge to Out-Caſts. God will find, or be a Sanctuary to his, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 11.16. Or <hi>Moab</hi> ſhall be a ſhelter to God's Out-Caſts; of whom ſhall you be afraid, is it of God's Rod, in whoſe Hand is it? reconcile you to him, and the Rod ſhall not reſt long, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 125.3.) but drop in the Fire: Is it of your Neighbours? Alas ſome dare not hurt you, leſt they diſcount, and pay too dear: ſome cannot, for the Fear, and good will, of him that dwelt in the Buſh, that reſtrains their Malice; and ſome will not hurt you, God has turn'd and chang'd their Hearts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout; ſome civil Officers are as <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Midwives, (<hi>Exod.</hi> 1.21.) and inſtead of a cloſe Nip, ſave the Infant, chooſing rather the rigour of a Fine or Priſon, than to cauſe others to ſuffer it in loſs of Religion and Right. Others ſee and fear that ſome Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Diſſenter of the Forenoon being cut off, out comes from behind the Curtain a Crew of Maſqueradoes to ſend them after us, After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon, and theſe will not much hurt us: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides thoſe do incline to Lenity from whom you look'd for Rigor, and many ſee driving with <hi>Engliſh</hi> Spirits) does never long obtain, unleſs to a cloſe hatred, which vents it ſelf home by the firſt fair Seaſon. Or is it loſs of Goods you fear, (<hi>Heb.</hi> 10.34.) ſome Quakers have loſt far more; and if you like not their Faith,
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:151110:150"/>or Worſhip, why does your Fear reflect on your own, and their undauntedneſs gets the Praiſe? But to all that fear ſpoil of Goods, or feel it; I ſay as once the Prophet (of the hundred Talents,) <hi>the Lord is able to give thee much more than this,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 25.9. The Lord is ſeeking to cure us of our dead Fears, as one that was a dying (but very covetous) jingling his Bags about, awaken'd his Lethargy: (<hi>Hor. lib.</hi> 3. <hi>Satyr.</hi>) God is willing to cure us, by cupping or ſcarrifying us, to rub Life in us.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Is God our Defence, leave him not, for ſome other Refuge; who would leave the Lord of Hoſts to humor an Enemy? forſake the Fountain, to borrow of a Ciſtern? deſert the Rock, to lye open in the Plain? quit the Waters of <hi>Siloe, Iſa.</hi> 8.6. that run ſoftly, for them of another place? as <hi>Iſrael</hi> did, <hi>Jer.</hi> 18.14. God's Worſhip is liken'd to a cool Stream, that runs from the Snow of <hi>Lebanon;</hi> Idolatry to ſome inflaming Waters, that neither cool, nor comfort the Commers: How often has your Soul been chear'd, ſitting at Chriſt's Foot? And (as Chriſt ſaid, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.67.) will you now go all away, and leave the Maſter to ſhift, and fend for himſelf? As all the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples were fore-warned; <hi>Chap.</hi> 16.32. and yet not fore-armed, for ſo they did: It was a good Reſolve in them that ſaid, <hi>And we will not forſake the Houſe of our God,</hi> Neh. 10.39. and a good Command, Thou ſhalt not forſake the <hi>Levite, Deut.</hi> 12.19. And a ſad Charge
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:151110:150"/>on ſome that left God for <hi>Baal, Jer.</hi> 11.13, 17. And is not our Guilt hereby detected? How many (once in the Separation) that are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd back to the Vomit they once caſt up; and wallow in the Mire of a worldly Worſhip, they once were (or ſeem'd to be) waſh'd from? Some have a large Latitude in Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and can go to worſhip in any Place: As if God had ſet no Bounds by Law, theſe make all ripe for Popery, <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> or <hi>Sociniant, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, Mahomet,</hi> a <hi>Friday Sabbath, Eraſtians,</hi> (any thing that's upmoſt.) Subſtitute but O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to Man in God's room, and place; and a Popiſh-Prieſt in the Pariſh-Pulpit, and ſo make all come to Publick; in reverence of God's Ordinances, and the publick Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies: And <hi>Adam Cozen</hi>'s Rules are obtain'd, to reſtore Popery. Theſe Men have found (as Mr. <hi>Rogers</hi> ſaid) a breadth in God's nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row way: A large Elbow room for whatever pleaſes Men, eaſes Fleſh, ſaves Self; <hi>Peter</hi>'s <hi>Requiem</hi> (<hi>Mat.</hi> 16.22.) is the Note <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, pleaſes them: But to pleaſe God as <hi>Abel</hi> did, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.5. is not the thing minded.</p>
            <p>Let me deal with theſe a little. Two ſorts of them are viſible; ſome of the <hi>Levitical.</hi> Tribe or Order, that make (as thoſe of <hi>Anathoth</hi>) <hi>Jeremy</hi>'s Town, the fuller of Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, to that Prophet: So that God threatned them with ſad Evils, <hi>Jer.</hi> 11.23. <hi>Paul</hi> had no little trouble with Preachers of Chriſt, that did it out of Envy, as theſe lay down out of
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:151110:151"/>Fear. 2. Others are of the Latitude-Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; a little to both.</p>
            <p>For the firſt ſort: I ask if you received your Miniſtry <hi>Jure Divino,</hi> from Chriſt, dare you lay't aſide, and put Chriſt and it, as ſtollen Goods, under the Cloak? Are you of <hi>John-Marks</hi> Spirit, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.13. &amp; 15.38. now to leave your work? Or as <hi>Demas,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.10. to forſake <hi>Paul,</hi> and embrace this preſent World, and its way, for eviting the Croſs? Was not <hi>Archippus</hi> to fulfil his Miniſtry, <hi>Col.</hi> 4.17. Or did you receive it of Man, and to him are to reſign it?</p>
            <p n="2">2. Is complyance in Idol-Temples, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.10. going to <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel,</hi> bowing to <hi>Baal,</hi> ſitting or drinking with the Superſtitious, (<hi>Mat.</hi> 24.49.) in Acts of Religious Adoration, a Witneſs for or againſt Defection? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.4. Are you turn'd as ſilly Sheep (that once were call'd Paſtors) to bleat after other Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds, that Chriſt never ſent, (<hi>Joh.</hi> 10.4, 5.) nor bid you to go after them? Can you fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Strangers, or is it your mark to be Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers of Wolves? Is this your blowing the Silver Trumpet, (<hi>Numb.</hi> 10.2, 4.) or ſtanding in the Gap (<hi>Ezek.</hi> 13.5, 6.) in the Day of the Lords Battel, and Mens Defections: to found thus uncertainly, (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.8.) You aſſure me of no great valour for the Truth, but let <hi>Luther</hi> or who will, be ſtiled <hi>(Tuba Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellionis,)</hi> you make ſure to be none; this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues your Courage is daunted.</p>
            <pb n="277" facs="tcp:151110:151"/>
            <p n="3">3. Looks it not like a declining of the Camp of Chriſt, the work of the Goſpel, and a ſetting your Face <hi>Babel,</hi> not <hi>Zion</hi>-wards? Does Chriſt call, by his laſt Will, (and <hi>John</hi> the Secretary of it, <hi>Rev.</hi> 18.4.) <hi>Come out of her?</hi> (and ſix or ſeven times before,) <hi>O flee, deliver every Man his Soul,</hi> (<hi>Jer.</hi> 50.8.28. <hi>Chap.</hi> 51.6.45, 50. <hi>Zac.</hi> 2.6, 7.) be as the <hi>Hee-Goats before the Flock? &amp;c.</hi> and dare you lead us back? did Chriſt aſcend to give Gifts to you, (<hi>Eph.</hi> 4.8.) that you may (at your pleaſure) hide (<hi>Mat.</hi> 25.25.) and ſtifle in a ſinful ſilence; or did the firſt bleſſed Apoſtles of the Goſpel ſo, (<hi>Acts</hi> 4.20. <hi>Chap.</hi> 5.20.) when no ſooner out of Priſon for one Sermon, but they were in the Temple (as the Angel bad them) for another, and could (or durſt) do no other. I dare ſay, Chriſt can find (to your Shame) ſome better and bolder Witneſſes (even in <hi>Newgate</hi>) than you are at preſent.</p>
            <p n="4">4. It looks (in Senſe) as tho you ſaid you meant to evite a Priſon, by being aſhamed of Chriſt and his Words in ſuch a vile Age, <hi>Mark</hi> 8.38. or were reſolv'd only to tread out the Corn, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 10.11. or do that Service of Chriſt that has Meat or Maintenance an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nex't to it, but not to break the hard Clods of <hi>Babel:</hi> As if you never meant Chriſt ſhould ride his Fathers Embaſſy on you: has not your Maſter cauſe to complain of you, as uſeleſs, and unkind? may he not lay you quite aſide?</p>
            <pb n="278" facs="tcp:151110:152"/>
            <p n="5">5. Is Scandal of no weight with you, to ſtop your courſe of Defection; is't nothing to you to grieve them Chriſt would not have ſo? <hi>Ezek.</hi> 13.22. or wound a poor Brother for whom Chriſt died? 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.12. If you ſay 'tis their weakneſs not to do ſo, then you that are ſtrong ſhould bear with their Infirmities, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.1. and not to pleaſe, or eaſe your ſelf to load them with Grief, that have ſeen you practiſe the contrary, and would ſtill do it, if the Terror of Loſs or Pain were off: Who anſwers for the Souls, that by your ill Example, are tempted to do what Conſcience after checks for, and gives no place in? to caſt a Scandal 'fore God's <hi>Iſrael,</hi> was <hi>Balaam</hi>'s Sin, but it ill becomes you that came with us out of <hi>Egypt.</hi> (<hi>Rom.</hi> 14, 13. <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.14.)</p>
            <p n="6">6. How dare you venture your Souls to ſit under Means, that he ſays ſhall not profit, <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.32. and (which is worſe) lies under his Curſe, <hi>Mal.</hi> 1.14. it's the Lord's Word-commanding, his Preſence and Bleſſing ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding a mean, that makes it tend to our Good: If theſe be away, it's good for us to be abſent; the Curſe of a dwindling Soul is no ſmall Curſe: As he comes not in the Harlots Houſe himſelf, ſo he bids us avoid the Door, <hi>Prov.</hi> 5.8. Oh where is that pure Heart, that tenderneſs of Conſcience, that Abſtinence from Evils (even in ſhow, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5.22.) that was wont to be the Glory of the old Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick <hi>Albigenſes,</hi> of thoſe call'd <hi>Cathariſts,</hi> or
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:151110:152"/>
               <hi>Puritans;</hi> of them <hi>Samoſetanians;</hi> of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctoral Princes, that left the Emperor at Door (going in to Maſs) and durſt go in no farther? The leaſt Truth or Duty, if it be Chriſt's, is of value above all our Intereſts; and a Call to a noble Suffering, the leſs it is, (if the Cauſe be Chriſt's) the more glorious is our Paſſion; and (as one ſays) we are unthrifty Bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupts, to pawn or ſpend in 20 years, what others in one or 200 years have purchas'd and convey'd to us at ſo dear an Expence, both of Prayers and Tears, Paſſions and Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures: and if we part ſo eaſily with God's Goſpel aad Truth, (a better Inheritance can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be) from our Seed: God will not ſpare the Civil Rights, all the Charters on Earth are not of a Straws value unto it.</p>
            <p n="7">7. (And no more) If a courſe of Defecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſpring from the love of Worldly Eaſe, Safety, or Honour; it's juſt with God to let in a <hi>Barbarian</hi> Spirit, to rob you of that and Truth too: As on the contrary oft to loſe all, is Chriſt's way to ſave all, and Life Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal too, <hi>Mark</hi> 8.35. 'Tis a Story (worthy Letters of Gold) that of a holy Biſhop of <hi>Nola, Paulinus,</hi> being very rich, yet his Heart ſet on the true Treaſure, he was by the <hi>Goths</hi> (with that whole City <hi>Nola</hi>) ſpoil'd of all at once, and made a Priſoner. And now the pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Soul thus prays to God: <hi>(Sic in corde ſuo precabatur, Domine, non excrucier propter aurum &amp; argentum: <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>bi enim ſunt omnia mea,
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:151110:153"/>tu ſcis.</hi> Aug. de Civ. Dei. <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 9. Lord let me not be much troubled for Silver and Gold, thou knoweſt where my All was ſtored at thy command: Thou told us afore, that for our Sins, theſe <hi>Goths</hi> would ſpoil us; and ſo I took warning where to lay my Wealth: Others were not ſo wiſe, and learn'd Wit <hi>(conſequente experientiâ d dicerunt)</hi> by after Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience; but hid their Treaſure from Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, which coſt them extream Tortures to diſcover it, and ſome dyed that refuſed, loſing both their Life and Treaſure, to ſhow them (<hi>Quanta eſſent ſuſtinenda pro Chriſto qui tanta patiebantur pro auro.</hi> Ibid.) what they ſhould have ſuffered for Chriſt's ſake, that would endure ſuch things for Gold. And in the Iſſue my Author obſerves, <hi>Nemo Chriſtum confitendum amiſit;</hi> none loſt by confeſſing of Chriſt. <hi>Nemo aurum niſi negando ſervavit,</hi> and none kept his Gold but by denying it.</p>
            <p>O had we that brave Self-denial, what a true Glory would it put on our Profeſſion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ludov. Vives</hi> (in's Notes) cites <hi>Paulus Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conus,</hi> and <hi>Greg.</hi> Dialog.) and gives a full Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to this holy Man's noble Self-denial, in ſpending all he had to redeem Captives; And after being moved at the Tears of a ſad Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, for her Son, croſt into <hi>Africa</hi> (with her) to ſeek him, gave his Perſon to be Captive for him, and ſo reſtor'd the Son free to the Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow: So growing famous with the <hi>Barbari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> by that means, he got alſo all his Citizens ſet free from Captivity.</p>
            <pb n="281" facs="tcp:151110:153"/>
            <p>In all this I gain a twofold Obſervation: That Lenity in any Epiſcopal Order, and Self-denial, is the nobleſt and trueſt way to get Repute. That concerns the trapper'd Dons of our Day. And, ſecondly; Shuffling and ſave-Skin Doctrine may hold a while, but with a barbarous Tory will at laſt hazard both Truth and Peace.</p>
            <p>Now were our Dons and Doctors, and Pious Men, as skill'd in the ſtraight Rule of Scripture, as in the Eraſtian Politicks, the Light on our little Hills would ſoon deſcend to the lower Grounds of the Vulgar; for alas! the rigid Conformiſt urg'd (as one told me of late) <hi>R. B.</hi>'s Holineſs for an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument to conform: And if that be the <hi>genus ſummum</hi> of their Topicks, I think it will ſcrew in Salt, Spittle, and Cream, to conform us to <hi>Rome</hi> alſo.</p>
            <p>But alas! the poor People by this Means are left indifferent, and unſtable as Water. Thoſe of the like Latitude (which is the moſt) dance as theſe pipe, and (as <hi>Barna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas</hi> was by <hi>Peter, Gal.</hi> 2.14.) are carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with that Diſſimulation. The reſt (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing feweſt) grieved in Heart, and weary'd by many Threats of the Seſſions, and <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi>'s Laws on the one hand; and by the Doctors-Commons, and Epiſcopal Canons on the other; every Pedantick Prieſt, with his Thraſonick Threats, playing the Tyrant by lawleſs Excommunications, to vex and undo
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:151110:154"/>them; ſo that it would move an Heart of Stone, to ſee how many Families and Perſons are turn'd out of Church, Houſe, Trade, and Shop, in all Places, Cities and Corporations, the Number of which is not eaſy to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Now to ſupport theſe latter, (and call on the former) I ſhall here only cite that Call in <hi>John,</hi> (<hi>Rev.</hi> 18.4.) to come out of <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon;</hi> where I obſerve two Notes, and two Arguments in the Text.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) God's People are apt to linger in <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,</hi> even at or upon her Fall approaching. <hi>Lot</hi>'s hovering in <hi>Sodom,</hi> (<hi>Gen.</hi> 19.12, 15, 16, 17.) was a Type of this. Two Angels bid him and his go out, tell him the Place was to be deſtroy'd, call on him to haſten, and at laſt muſt pull him out by the hand, and bid him flee for's Life, and all but enough to ſave him. We have had two Angels ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling us: The firſt Epiſcopal, (Biſhop <hi>Hall</hi>'s <hi>No Peace with Rome,</hi> p. 631. §. 22.) I know not (ſays he) how the Houſe can ever be repaired, it muſt be quite pull'd down. The ſecond Angel took up the Cry where they left off, and by the ableſt Pens and Pulpits made it loud and audible, in which I could cite ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the moſt learned and pious. Yet inſtead of obeying, lo, the Cry is, <hi>Let us make us a Captain to return to</hi> Egypt. <hi>Numb.</hi> 14.4. And how far this may obtain, God knows; and the ſeeing Eye may affect the Heart. And
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:151110:154"/>ſome ſay plainly, As only the Oil of Scorpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons cures the Scorpion's Bite; ſo Popery muſt cure our Catholick Eyes, that will not ſee't, till it comes. (<hi>H. Burton,</hi> of the two laſt Trumpets, cites Mr. <hi>Throckmorton</hi>'s Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, <hi>p.</hi> 84.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) My ſecond Note is, That God's Call is very cogent out of <hi>Babel-Rome,</hi> yea, he will have us out, or he'll pull till the Arm and Shoulders crack for't; and if yet we will ſtay, ſee the Evils it will tend to,</p>
            <p>In Two Motives.</p>
            <list>
               <item>A Participation 1. In her Sin.</item>
               <item>A Participation 2. In her Plagues.</item>
            </list>
            <p n="1">1. To evite her Sin, we are all call'd and warn'd out to avoid her Guilt. Some Sins ſhe has in common with others; ſome are pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to her above others, as Idolatry, Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition, Hereſy, and Perſecution for Religion and Conſcience: Theſe are bred with her, and fed up among all her Daughters, who learn of the old Harlot to be and do like her, (<hi>Ezek,</hi> 23.13.) Now all that retain, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn in to her, are Partakers in thoſe Sins; and that does God forbid, eſpecially to Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, (1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.23.) and (next) to all others. Are we not bid to come out and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part? (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.17.) and have we not Sins perſonal, ſufficient to ſink us, or to act all the
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:151110:155"/>Repentance we can attain, but we muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract Guilt by participation with others? O how will you anſwer your Judg at the laſt Day, to pull on your own Souls the Guilt of all the Blood of holy Martyrs, ſpilt by the Papal Hierarchy in the Marian Days, and their Succeſſors in the ſame Spirit? When alas! it rather calls on you and us all, to ſet Days apart to atone it, which yet never was done. Wherefore it makes me fear a Relapſe to Popery, that all may be diſcounted at once for: And any that conſult <hi>Jo. Squire</hi> of <hi>Shore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditch,</hi> on 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. <hi>p.</hi> 626. or Dr. <hi>T. Taylor</hi>'s <hi>Chriſt's Victory over the Dragon,</hi> p. 741, <hi>cum ſequent.</hi> may ſee cauſe to increaſe that Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy. The firſt in theſe Words, (as <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi> to <hi>Africa,</hi> ſo he to <hi>England</hi>): <hi>Multis vapulet,</hi> we know his Will, and do it not, and ſhall be beat with many Stripes, and the Pope ſhall gather the Rod. It may verify <hi>Campian</hi>'s Exprobration; The <hi>Engliſh</hi> love Preaching, not the Preachers: Or that of <hi>Pererius</hi> to <hi>England, Veniet tandem iniquitatis complementum;</hi> that is, <hi>England</hi>'s Sin (at laſt) comes to a fulneſs. The latter grave Doctor has this fatal Simily: As the Moon ſuffers no Eclipſe but at Full, when fartheſt diſtant from the Sun; ſo the Church in the Fulneſs of Proſperity, has now the greateſt Eclipſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fartheſt off the Sun. O Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> ſee to't now in thy fulneſs of Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, thy Diſtance from Chriſt cauſe not thy
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:151110:155"/>Eclipſe by Popery. Now Miniſters make way for Antichriſt, as being <hi>opibus &amp; potentiâ ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor; virtutibus verò, &amp; pietate minor:</hi> Tho you be greater in Wealth and Power, yet leſs in Piety and Vertue. <hi>Jerome in Vita Mal.</hi> p. 740.</p>
            <p n="2">2. All that dare ſhare in her Sin, look aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly to partake of her Plagues. Death is in the Pot; taſte not the Broth, or the Fleſh, Mourning follows that. <hi>Knox</hi> refuſed to take a Biſhoprick, 'cauſe it had <hi>(aliquid commune cum Antichriſto)</hi> ſomewhat of Antichriſt. Can a ſeverer Threat be read; <hi>If any do worſhip the Beaſt, or his Image, or take his Mark in the Forehead, or Right-hand; he ſhall be tormented with Fire and Sulphur, before the Lord, and the Lamb.</hi> Rev. 14.10. That Fire they gave us, ſhall return hotter. No Papiſt can go beyond a Reprobate, ſays <hi>Perkins.</hi> This Text adds one Word ſharper, <hi>[without mixture]</hi> i.e. of Lenity, or Mercy; yet it's fully mix'd with all that Guilt or Wrath can inflict.</p>
            <p>I conclude this Diſſuaſive from a ſlaviſh de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerting pure Worſhip, for Antichriſtian Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacy, as <hi>Edw. Bagſhaw</hi> does his Book, with part of that pious, learned Biſhop <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher</hi>'s Catechiſm, <hi>p.</hi> 441. where Antichriſt is ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd, as one that under a colour of being for Chriſt, (as his Vicegerent) oppoſes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to Chriſt in all his Offices, and bearing Authority in Church and Commonwealth; a Mother of Fornications to Kings and People;
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:151110:156"/>one that cauſes many to ſin by Laws that are adviſedly made; — that allows inceſtuous Marriages, and to break Faith and Leagues, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and (for uſe of it) ſays, All that partake of <hi>Rome</hi>'s Sin, are under her Curſe, and ſo all ought to hate her. — So infers, that no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concillation can be had with <hi>Rome,</hi> nor can we communicate with them, unleſs we ſhare in their Deſtruction, for Popery deſtroys the Vitals of Religion. So (he concludes, <hi>ibid. p.</hi> 442.) thoſe that are off it, ſhould free themſelves of the Remnants of Popery, leſt God in Judgment bring the whole on them again. So is the third Caution. Now one more I will add.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, and laſtly; Beware of provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king your Shield of Defence, to call off his glorious Covert, and leave you, (as <hi>Aaron</hi> made the People, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32.25.) naked, and open to every Laſh of the Tongue or Pen, or to all the Feet of Beaſts, to tear and tread; and to every Storm of God's Fury and Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance, that may fall: for if you provoke your Defence, where will you flie to hide? <hi>Ahab</hi> did ſo, and in Battel, (tho well arm'd) an Arrow (drawn at a venture) pierc'd him betwixt the Joints of the Harneſs, (1 <hi>Kings</hi> 22.34.) and ſo verifies (through his Wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs) the Prophet's Word he hated; he juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly died in War, that hated <hi>Micaiah,</hi> a Son of Peace. If the Lord be provoked to grub
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:151110:156"/>up the Hedge of Providence and Reſtraint, and dig down the Wall of Protection about his Vineyard, (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 5.6.) the Entrance of the Boar and Fox is eaſy. And then the Lord being gone, he, and the Enemy, anſwer (both) roughly: The one ſays, God has forſaken him, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 71.11.) perſecute and take him (or them) now; and if we cry to God, he ſays, <hi>Go to your Gods, I'll deliver you no more.</hi> Judg. 10.13. What provokes to ſuch a Withdraw? I anſwer briefly,</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) Unfruitfulneſs does it. The Lord ſerved that firſt Vineyard ſo, that inſtead of Grapes (that he looked for) it yielded wild and ſowre ones, that he looked not for; and ſo it was trod down, and eaten up. (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 5.5, 7. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 15.2, 7.) And when the Maſter came, lo, he's ſerved ſo, and worſe; they kill'd him, (<hi>Mat.</hi> 21.41, 43.) and that Goſpel Tenure was let out to us: And if the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God be again took from us, the ſame Caſe that was theirs, may be alſo ours.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) Formality does it. A luke warm Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion is next to none, and as ungrateful and nauſeous (as the Water that is tepid) to God's Stomach, and to be caſt up in any Corner out of Sight; and if it be ſet aſide, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward is coldeſt. (<hi>Rev.</hi> 3.1, 2, 15, 16.) A Name to live is hateful to Chriſt, (Life being abſent) the Carcaſe without the Soul of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is good for nothing, ſave for the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Eagles and Vultures to pick.

            <p>Other Cautions might be urged, and Cauſes of God's wrath, indigitate; to clear this laſt: (but things multiply in the breaking.) In a word; if the Lord depart, upon the provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of profeſt Sons and Daughters, (<hi>Deut.</hi> 32.19.) it may afflict ſome of the beſt firſt, and cauſe them to lament after the Lord: but they being hid in the day of the Lords wrath, (as his promiſe is, <hi>Zeph.</hi> 2.3.) you that fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it leaſt, ſhall at laſt feel it moſt; when you would gladly call for a Prayer, as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> of <hi>Moſes,</hi> Exod. 9.28. Or as <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> the King of <hi>Iſrael</hi> did of the Man of God, from <hi>Judah,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 13.6. Or as <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> of <hi>Peter,</hi> (<hi>Act.</hi> 8.24. &amp;c.) to avert that Wo threatned on him; and all in vain; for 'tis hard to avert wrath threatned, far harder to aleviate it, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted; but to bear it, when ſettled, impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. And no one thing more affects the Lord, than the purity of his Worſhip: or more af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts him (on the contrary) than to ſee it profaned, or perſecuted. Some advice, poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, may conclude this.</p>
            <pb n="290" facs="tcp:151110:158"/>
            <p>Now for affirmative Advice, in two or three words.</p>
            <p n="1">1. If God defends his own Service and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, how ſhould we pray for, reſt on, and bleſs his Name for it? Of theſe, each a little.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Pray for it: God will be ſought unto, even for that he is reſolved to give, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 39. <hi>v.</hi> 37. Promiſes are ſo far from releaſing Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, that they rather oblige and incourage to it: though the matter be ſure, and time ſet; yet it is good to gain aſſurance, that is, by Prayer: the firſt four Commands, reſpect God's Worſhip, for Object, Mediums, Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and Time: and the firſt Petition our Lord calls us to make, (<hi>Mat.</hi> 6.) looks directly at Worſhip: what we ought to pray for, we are alſo to endeavour in the <hi>Act:</hi> God wills his Sons Kingdom, (ſurely) and up it ſhall, that his Will may be done on Earth, as 'tis (by Angels) in Heaven: yet are we to pray that Kingdom may come.</p>
            <p>Now here riſes a Queſtion: God is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence to us, are we to reſt in Prayer? or is ought incumbent on us, to defend for, and with God, reſpecting Worſhip.</p>
            <p>I confeſs, 'tis a cloſe, and critical point, and to anſwer right, is to ſplit an hair: the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemma</hi> is cornuted, if God defends, what need we do it: or if we do it, how is it aſcribed to the Lord of Hoſts.</p>
            <pb n="291" facs="tcp:151110:158"/>
            <p>For anſwer then, 'tis a caſe oft uſeful, ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom toucht, and perillous to ventilate: dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers lye on both hands, I muſt ſail betwixt <hi>Scylla</hi> and <hi>Charybdis,</hi> to do it well: I only dare to eſſay.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1ſt.</hi> In general: The end and means con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur, the firſt Agent, and the under Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; the firſt doth not ſeclude, or preoccu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate the latter: though God doth ſave us, yet he bids us ſave our ſelves, from an outward Generation, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.40. He delivers <hi>Zion,</hi> yet bids, <hi>Deliver thy ſelf, O Zion, that dwells with the Daughter of Babylon,</hi> Zach. 2.7. The Lord had might ſufficient to conquer <hi>Jabin</hi> by one Angel; yet curſes <hi>Meroz,</hi> that helpt him not againſt the Mighty, <hi>Judg.</hi> 5.23.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2dly.</hi> I ſay, Time and Judgment belong to each Work; as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſays, (<hi>Eccl.</hi> 8.6.) and becauſe of that, ſo few knowing the Time, and God's Way, but Judging by Succeſſes, in a <hi>poſt facto</hi> way (which is an unſure Rule) the Miſery of Man is great on the Earth.</p>

            <p n="4">4. To the thing I only ſay, it is good to be on God's part, he is defenſive on his <hi>Iſrael</hi>'s account: are they to ſtand as ſottiſh ſtocks, and neither uſe hand nor reaſon, to ſecure Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and Peace? <hi>Perkins,</hi> on <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.32.33. notes; that a lawful War is very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the Faith of the Goſpel; and if ſo, who will deny Princes a power of ſelf defence? it is innately planted in the very order, and form of nature: the frame of Civil Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and all humane Conſtitutions, and Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies Politick: the Title given to our Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs, of, <hi>Defender of the Faith,</hi> (when it anſwers the thing) who dares queſtion?

            <p n="5">5. <hi>Pro hic &amp; nunc,</hi> I further ſay, ſhould the <hi>Defender of the Faith</hi> call us to a War againſt <hi>Rome,</hi> and that riſing <hi>Mounſieur</hi> (that Sword ſhould not be ſheathed; unto the gates of <hi>Rome</hi>) now will any <hi>Proteſtant</hi> ſcruple that the late <hi>Popiſh</hi> Plot (now dormant) may at laſt iſſue in ſuch a War, to anſwer the long tail of that late Comet: yea, that Sword is drawn al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready (abroad in <hi>Europe</hi>) that will end in <hi>Romes</hi> uter Ruine.</p>

            <pb n="295" facs="tcp:151110:161"/>
            <p>Now for matter of Prayer in this; we may from the word, thus take direction, partly for Supplication; partly, Deprecation and Imprecation.</p>
            <p n="1">1. For Supplication; as firſt, that God's mighty Preſence may be ever with, and among his People; with this, the Glory, or Defence doth come, or go: and going, O the Miſeries that enter at <hi>that Door;</hi> for God's Throne to ſtand under the foot of an inſulting Intruder, to trample on it, is, and ought to be for a La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation. One of <hi>Darius</hi>'s Courtiers, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that rich Table of his Maſter, put as a foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtool to <hi>Alexander</hi> (being a little man) to lift him on the Throne, wept; and being ask't the Cauſe, anſwered, <hi>He could not but weep, that being the Table his Maſter had ſate in Counſel at.</hi> So <hi>Alexander</hi> cauſed to remove it.</p>
            <p>If it affect us, to ſee Man, in pride, tread on the Throne of the Lord; how ſoon may God reſtore his <hi>Ark</hi> to its Glory?</p>
            <p>And <hi>2dly.</hi> If he ſtands on tiptoe at the Door, pray his Stay: how oft is this urged, ſays <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> Jer. 14.9. leave us not, and with this Subject. Mr. <hi>T. Hooker</hi> of <hi>N. E.</hi> took leave of old, at <hi>Chelmsford:</hi> If God go, away goes the Goſpel with him: Prayer (if it be right) is a taking hold of God, to ſtay (and has held) him.</p>
            <p n="3">3. If gone, cry after him; is it not time to
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:151110:162"/>cry, if they take away our God? (as he ſaid, <hi>Judg.</hi> 18.24.) when they askt, <hi>What ayles thee?</hi> One God is our all, and more than a hundred elſe; he is ſeldom far from his People, but a Cry may reach his ears, ſtir his heart, and (it may be) cauſe his bowels to yern, and move him to a return.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <hi>4thly.</hi> Pray for Chriſt's Kingdom, Goſpel, Grace, and Power; ſay (as that <hi>Martyr</hi>) <hi>Yet a little longer, Lord!</hi> Yet—if the Goſpel fall <hi>Weſtward,</hi> and Prayer doth not (as <hi>Joſhua</hi>'s did, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 10.12.) cauſe its ſtay: as we loſe our Conqueſt; ſo a dark Night, and ſtormy follows; that few of us will ſee day after; and which is ſadder; to Poſterity (that want the Light we have) for they may fully loſe it, and curſe us for our Forfeitures.</p>
            <p>Under the Type of <hi>Solomon,</hi> it is ſaid, <hi>Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſhall be made for him, and dayly he ſhall be praiſed,</hi> Pſal. 72.15. And to that Propheſie, add Chriſt's Precept to Prayer, <hi>Thy Kingdom come,</hi> Mat. 6.10. Now hence is all our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection; this is the defence of the Truth, of the Goſpel, and all the Profeſſors thereof; and alſo of pure Worſhip, and the practiſers of it. On that Nail hangs our Civil and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Alls: Truth and Right ſtand, or fall at once: if we hang our All on a man, it will be a lye to us (as <hi>Charles</hi> 9. was to <hi>Coligni,</hi> ere that fatal Maſſacre) All <hi>Popery</hi> gets riſe by Perfidy and Treachery: <hi>nulla fides</hi> —
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:151110:162"/>is a <hi>Maxim,</hi> as cloſe follow'd as true: the Kingdom of Chriſt ſtill takes riſe with, and by the Goſpel. If Chriſt were not a King that could protect his own men and matters, our Prayers would be vain: <hi>Thou art my King of old;</hi> (ſaid <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 74.12.) what for? <hi>working Salvation in the midſt of the Land.</hi> He is a King that can do it, will he but reſolve againſt all our <hi>Unworthineſs,</hi> and (and his foes <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nwillingneſs</hi>) to be our King (as erſt he did, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 13.10.) though Prayer be mock't now, his coming to poſſeſs it, will confute both our fears, and our Enemies Blaſphemies: that Kingdom will tend to a 2 fold advantage, both unto Religion and Right.</p>
            <p n="1">1. To Religion, great Peace and Union ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crues by Chriſt's Kingdom. Two Prophets agree in this, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 11.6.8. <hi>The Wolf, Lyon, Leopard, dwell with the meek Lambs, Kids, and Sucklings of Chriſt: (i.e.)</hi> men as fierce, vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racious, venom'd in nature; ſhall put off, and change their ferial, immane, bad Natures to Chriſt's Followers, (not be chained only;) a Change ſhall obtain on them; and a little af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it is expreſly open'd ſo; <hi>for the Envy of</hi> Ephraim <hi>ſhall depart,</hi> verſ. 13. &amp;c. <hi>They ſhall not envy and vex each other.</hi> So doth <hi>Zacha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> foretel, <hi>ch.</hi> 14.8. <hi>When the Lord ſhall be King in all the Earth, then one Lord, and his Name one. (Name)</hi> notes Worſhip, and it ſhows that all fatal Differences ſhall <hi>center</hi> and
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:151110:163"/>
               <hi>terminate</hi> in one <hi>Object,</hi> one <hi>Dominator,</hi> and Saints only ſtrive which knows, and does the Lord's Will beſt. And ſo all Names of <hi>Diſſent</hi> and <hi>Conteſt</hi> ſhall relinquiſh their lifeleſs Forms, wherein the Enmity both breeds and feeds; and contentedly be buryed in Oblivion; <hi>That his Name, Power, and Worſhip may be one from the</hi> Eaſt <hi>to the</hi> Weſt, <hi>Mal.</hi> 1.11.</p>
            <p n="2">2. For Right, it ſhall not be run down by <hi>Might;</hi> the Poor ſhall have as true (and as much) Juſtice, for God's ſake, as the Prince. So is Scripture pregnant; the two great Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladies, that <hi>Bars</hi> and <hi>Courts</hi> groan with, of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyals and Delays, of Right, ſhall by this have ſuited Cures; the one by ſeeking out a wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Cauſe; the other, by haſting Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 16.5. And Chriſt <hi>(that Tree of Life)</hi> in his days, will ſpread the Earth over with Branches, laden with all ſorts of bleſſed Fruits.</p>
            <p>How then ſhould we pray for that King and Kingdom that alone will bring that Fruit? Now when we ſeek this Kingdom, and <hi>thirſt</hi> for the Righteouſneſs of it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.6.6, 33. When we pray, the Word may run, and be glorified, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3 2. It is a good Argument of our being on <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s ſide: and this is the Defence <hi>David</hi> begg'd of God, for his Life, for fear of the Enemy, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 64.1. And often, for the good Cauſe he ingag'd for. And it being all the Service you can do, had you not
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:151110:163"/>need ſay the old Prayers with a new Spirit; that God may help yet once, as <hi>Sampſon</hi> pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and then pulled at the very Pillars, <hi>Judg.</hi> 16.28. <hi>v.</hi> 30. And ſo dyed a <hi>Martyr</hi> for <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el,</hi> and a Judge againſt the <hi>Philistims,</hi> though himſelf ſunk in that <hi>Adventure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And truly the ſtate of God's people is ſuch, ſome aged, worn out, and weak; ſome poor, low, and diſcouraged; many of the Rich, ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous, and of <hi>Nabal's</hi> temper: the reſt, not yet pinch't with the Sorrows and Hardſhips of their own Fleſh; and all divided in their Notions about theſe Things: that if by our Prayers we can ſerve Religion no better, than by a Carnal Weapon, we are like to ſuffer as ſharp a Laſh, and as long as ever; unleſs God, by an <hi>Act of arbitrary Grace, Works, Wonders</hi> for us, as here he did at <hi>Samuel</hi>'s Prayers for <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and thunder vengeance on the impla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable, in an extraordinary way: and why not ſo now? Since Promiſes do oft entertain us with hope,<note place="margin">

<pb n="300" facs="tcp:151110:164"/>that ſaves the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pright in Heart.</hi> In a third, he prays, <hi>Let the Name,</hi> (that is) <hi>the Power, Worſhip, of the God of Jacob defend, or ſet thee on high,</hi> pſal. 20.1, 2. (as the word is.) A fourth runs, <hi>Be thou a Rock of Strength, a Houſe of Defence to ſave me,</hi> ch. 31.2. A fifth time, he reſolves to wait on him, <hi>for God is my Defence,</hi> ch. 59.1, 9. v. 17. It was when <hi>Saul</hi> watcht the Houſe, to kill him, <hi>ch.</hi> 62.2, 6. What need had we of ſuch Prayers?</p>
            <p>I conclude the Direction for prayer, with that of the Apoſtle, — <hi>That the Word may run—and we may be delivered from unreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable men,</hi> (or <hi>abſurd</hi>) <hi>men,</hi>

            <p>Now, <hi>2dly.</hi> For <hi>Deprecation,</hi> it is imply'd in our Lords Direction, <hi>Lead us not into Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,</hi> Mat. 6.13. So then we are to pray a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all the Inlets of Temptation, that (within, or without) draw us to evil. And more particularly —</p>
            <p n="1">1. Deprecate God's Receſs; <hi>Leave us not,</hi> was (and ſtill is) an uſeful Requeſt, <hi>Exod.</hi> 33.15. <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Jeremiah</hi> did ſo; the one choſe to dwell ſtill in the Wilderneſs with God, rather than to go into the Land with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out him. The other crys, <hi>Leave us not; we cannot ſenſe this Loſs, till after; His Preſence is our Glory,</hi> Jer. 14.9.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Deprecate ſelling into men's hands, that is ſlavery; this follows that; ſelling, giving up, and delivering into men's hands (<hi>Iſai.</hi> 47.6.) are acts near of kin: and as he gets nought of the enemy, (but <hi>Blaſphemy</hi>) <hi>Pſal.</hi> 44.12. ſo to be ſure we loſe both civil and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Rights by that Bargain; once in ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, you may work long ere you buy off the Yoak; men hardly let go a Slave.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Pray againſt the Sins, that demerit both: If God protect his Worſhip, and us in it, ſhall we forget our Glory and Defence at once? We may do it eaſily, but are ſure to repent it dearly. What Sins do conduce to this, I need not here to recite: but a ſmall fret, as <hi>Miri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ams,</hi>
               <pb n="302" facs="tcp:151110:165"/>or wrong touch, as <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zah</hi>'s; or falſe fire, as <hi>Aaron's</hi> two Sons, <hi>Lev.</hi> 10.2. or For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality, and Mixtures, ſoon drive God away, or provoke him.</p>
            <p n="3">3. For <hi>Imprecations</hi> in our Prayers, let us firſt premiſe a Word, next provoke, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect.</p>
            <p>I depone two <hi>Poſitions,</hi> and diſtinguiſh next.</p>
            <p n="1">1. There is a lawful, holy Curſe, now un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Goſpel, (as was under the Law) <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> curſt the rage of <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Levi,</hi> Gen. 49.7. So <hi>David,</hi> the Sons of men, that incenſt <hi>Saul</hi> againſt him; and drave him out, to ſerve other Gods, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 26.19. So <hi>Jeremiah</hi> had a holy Arrow for his indurate Foes, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3. <hi>ult. Paul</hi> had the like for the <hi>Galatians</hi> Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blers, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.12.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Some men are fit Subjects of a <hi>Curſe,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt whom this Weapon is of right to be drawn, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 109.17, 18. The ſin to death ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes from all benefit of, or bleſſing by Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.16. The delivery to Satan, is a juſt Curſe <hi>(Clave non errante)</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.5. and perſons may demerit it, that yet do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, <hi>ch.</hi> 16.22.</p>
            <p>I confeſs, caution is to be uſed, in the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice and applying of this Curſe; I need not better to diſtinguiſh, than a grave Writer doth,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Ed. Gee of Prayer, <hi>p. 113.</hi>
               </note> in ſuch Caſes of Prayer. <hi>Some Impre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations are againſt ill Councils,
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:151110:165"/>and Practices, as</hi> Davids <hi>againſt Achitopel,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.31. Some againſt perſons; which are of two ſorts:
<list>
                  <item>1. For men's Conviction.</item>
                  <item>2. Or Confuſion.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>The 1. are leſs doubtful: the latter, he ranks under three heads: 1 As againſt God: Or, 2. As againſt the <hi>Churches Enemies:</hi> Or elſe 3. Againſt our own Adverſaries. Here the doubt lies: 1. If they did well? 2. If we may do the like? Now the firſt being grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; yet of this they ſay, <hi>Preſtat admirari, quam imitari.</hi> It is <hi>far better to admire than imitate them.</hi> And they are rather denun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciations predicted, than Deſires preſſed in Prayer.</p>
            <p>But all I would provoke to, is, to reaſſume the old Spirit of Prayer, that Chriſt's Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and Worthies had of old, in the Cauſe of God: To which, 1. A pure Zeal of God may be one motive; this moved <hi>Phinehas</hi> to <hi>act,</hi> and <hi>Elijah</hi> to intercede againſt <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Rom. 11.4. If this be not the motive, it is falſe fire.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Some are ſlated, <hi>Enemies to the Houſe of God;</hi> (as <hi>Antichriſt</hi> is) to his City, and any Wall of Defence, they ought to have: are of <hi>Sanballat's pernitious</hi> Spirit, would have that <hi>Wall</hi> and <hi>Work</hi> to ceaſe, and ſcorn the Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, <hi>Nehe.</hi> 4.4. Such deſpite is to be appealed againſt to God: and ſpeedy Vengeance call'd for.</p>
            <pb n="304" facs="tcp:151110:166"/>
            <p n="3">3. If Repentance doth reſtore the man, our Cry, Appeal, or Imprecation, may obtain the filling of the Face with ſhame, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 83.16. And the ſeeking of God's Name, is a very ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly end: this holy <hi>Curſe</hi> is the happy way to a true Bleſſing, and a good End.</p>
            <p n="4">4. God's Predictions are part of his Word, and matter for our Prayers, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.14. Now theſe are Predictions of what is to befall Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons (ſo and ſo) qualified; and ſpeak a part of his Will, which is to be done.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Scripture preſcribes ſuch <hi>Formula's</hi> for Prayer; and why doth the <hi>Liturgy</hi> preſcribe, and imitate it, if ſome were not ſo to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precated? as, <hi>Curſed is he that takes Bribes,</hi> or <hi>lyes with Neighbours Wives,</hi> Deut. 27.25. And if that be accurſt (and deſervedly) how far are ſome under it?</p>
            <p n="6">6. If the Wife of <hi>Lapidoth</hi> was too tart, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>So let all thine Enemies periſh:</hi> yet the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels word, <hi>Curſe ye Meroz,</hi> Judg. 5.23. is in our Cannon and Directory.</p>
            <p>Now, Rules to apply it to our <hi>Practice,</hi> are ſeven: 1. Mind Scripture Precepts and Preſidents: take not all things for Rules of <hi>Practice</hi> and <hi>Imitation</hi> in bulk.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Crave much of God's holy Spirit, many a <hi>Prayer</hi> is loſt, that ſavours of ſelf: none of thoſe miſcarry, the Spirit <hi>dictates.</hi> It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires not a common <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction,</hi> to pray, as that thundring <hi>Legion</hi> did (ſo called) in <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relians</hi> days.</p>
            <pb n="305" facs="tcp:151110:166"/>
            <p n="3">3. Watch, repreſs, and mortifie your own Spirits; <hi>We know not what Spirit we are of,</hi> Luk. 9.55. Our own Spirit ſavours of Sin, ſelf Revenge, Paſſion, falſe Zeal (as the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples) it is better ſuch be denyed than gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifyed.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Begin as Chriſt did, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.4. (and <hi>Paul</hi> bids, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.14, 20.) 1ſt. <hi>with Bleſſing:</hi> and try that way, (and curſe not) and that has a grant (virtually) of your Wiſh: for you heap <hi>Coals</hi> on the head of Enemies ſo, to conſume, or convince them; that is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Uſe ſtrong cryes of Faith, <hi>Great is the power of Faith,</hi> Heb. 5.7. She that feared <hi>Knox</hi>'s <hi>Prayers</hi> more than 20000, ſhows the force of Faith, in her Fear, that had no love for it; <hi>Joſh.</hi> 10.12. <hi>I cry, — then my Enemy turns back. — Pſal.</hi> 56.3, 9.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Fly to the ſucking Lamb, reſt not in your own power: this avails when all our Weapons are beat back; If his Incenſe go not up firſt, our <hi>Prayers</hi> will never deſcend in fiery Judgment, and Thundrings on the Enemy, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 8.35, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 6.9, 10.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Wait in Submiſſion for what Anſwer, and when God will; ſay, <hi>Let him</hi> (Shimei) <hi>Curſe,</hi> or, <hi>carry back the Ark.</hi> 2 Sam. 15.25. This Spirit obtains; and it is impoſſible, the wrongs of <hi>Ariel</hi> ſhould not pull down juſt Revenges, for the Patient; and Thunders on <hi>Adverſaries;</hi> as <hi>Hannah</hi> believed, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi>
               <pb n="306" facs="tcp:151110:167"/>4.10. I hear of many blaſted by this holy Zeal.</p>
            <p>Now for the ſecond Branch, let us (having Pray'd) reſt, and confide (not in it, but) in God: <hi>Prayer</hi> and <hi>Faith</hi> ſhould mutually ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the other: <hi>Prayer</hi> exonerates the heart of the Burthen; <hi>Faith</hi> puts it wholly on the Lord, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.18. So one is no more ſad: all <hi>Acts</hi> of Devotion (if right) relieve. <hi>Prayer</hi> flaps the Wing, acts Life; and the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Faith, is to crow in the dark, and cry, <hi>Day or the Morning</hi> cometh (on the Godly) <hi>and the Night alſo</hi> (on the Wicked) <hi>Iſai.</hi> 21.12. But now when all is run down; the <hi>Aſſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi> Wings over-ſpread <hi>Emanuel</hi>'s Land; <hi>Iſai.</hi> 8.8. the City of God, and all Religion; the Temple Aſſemblies, Altar, Service, Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, Propheſy, and all lye expoſed to a Siege and Overthrow, Now to reſt on God's Word, and have promiſe of Safety, is as quieting to do, as ſweet to hear on. God promiſed to deliver the City; told ſo to <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> (Iſai. 37.35.) he to the good King <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> v. 6-21. and the King to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who reſted on it, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 32.7, 8. Let the Godly in our day conſider the <hi>Parity</hi> of their Preſent, with previous Diſtreſſes; and then preponderate the Promiſe with the Peril, and ſee if there be not reſt for a weary Mind; recur to the nature, &amp; Attributes of God; <hi>His Name is a ſtrong Tower, the Righteous run into
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:151110:167"/>it, and are ſafe,</hi> Prov. 18.10. (or ſet on high) 'tis low with us, if we cannot truſt; if Foes make weary, and Faith gives no true reſt, we are ſoon gone. Doth God bid us requeſt him, and will he deny us Reſt? Or flee to him, and will he fail our Hope? Though God never had any without diſtreſs, yet never was his People diſtreſt without Deliverance: had we good hold of Chriſt's hand, the very Waves would bear us up, not ſink us, <hi>Mat.</hi> 14.30, 31.</p>
            <p>Are meanes of Defence inviſible, or ſay yet more, not in Being; he can create them ſoon. God alone, and nothing elſe (as I ſaid) is as much as God and all beſides (<hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>bi Supra</hi> p. 113.) What is in man, is placed there by Him; his Word gives both its Being and Bleſſing. When we uſe a mean (as duty is) and have it, we are to depend on him; and if he deny it, ſtill we can but depend: and that we ought, if we long wait for his Defence.</p>
            <p>Two Iſhues do ſtill faelicitate Saints <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations:</hi> the one relating to themſelves, the other to Enemies.</p>
            <p n="1">1. They are of God Bleſſed; all humane hope and help, the more it is reſted on, the worſe it proves, <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.7, 8. The more it pierceth the Hand, and ſo it intails a Curſe, and rends the Shoulder-blade, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 29.6, 7. But to ſay, <hi>In God is my Expectation,</hi> (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 62.5,—7.) is alſo a Glory, and is pronounc't now bleſſed, (and that many times over) tho
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:151110:168"/>its bliſs is yet little felt, or ſeen, till after, in the event.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Saints Expectation, ends well as to Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: in nature, we ſay, a ſtill ſerenity is a ſign fore-running ſore Tempeſts, and ſhaking Earthquakes. I look, that the ſtill hopes of the Saints, may have ſudden <hi>Hail, Storms, Earthquakes</hi> after; yea, and <hi>Heartquakes</hi> ſoon. What follows on waiting? Why, God riſes to the <hi>Prey,</hi> to pour out ſome <hi>Cataracts</hi> of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3.8. (with pain) on the head of the Wicked, <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.19. There were <hi>Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> that followed the aſcent of <hi>Incenſe,</hi> in Saints Prayers; and a ſilence went afore, half an hour, <hi>Rev.</hi> 8.1. 3. But I am ſure the ſeven Trumpets will be loud in our Age, <hi>v.</hi> 4, 5. And the ſeventh of them ſounds ſuch a <hi>Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> as will flaſh terrour in the Eyes and Hearts; and Fire on the Throne of the Beaſt, <hi>ch.</hi> 11.13. For (God hath ſaid it) <hi>Bleſſed are all they that wait for him,</hi> Iſai. 30.18.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Glory in your Shield and Shelter, boast of it; and walk ſuitable unto it: the Shields of the Earth belong to God,</hi> Pſal 47.9. The forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Words mention the Gatherings of the People of the God of <hi>Abraham:</hi> to note, that God guides, and weilds the Shields of the Earth, for the guarding of the Seed of <hi>Abraham.</hi> They that bear the <hi>Sword</hi> to puniſh the <hi>Evil,</hi> ſhould alſo have a <hi>Shield</hi> to <hi>protect</hi> the <hi>Good.</hi> Hence good <hi>Judges</hi> were to defend the poor People; ſo did <hi>Tola,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:151110:168"/>
               <hi>Abimelech</hi> (that <hi>Bramble</hi>) is grub'd up, <hi>Judg.</hi> 10.1. So is it given in Charge again, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 82.3. That ſo they may be like God: or elſe, he oft recalls that truſt (if not truly ſtewarded) and puts it in others (or takes it in his own) hand.</p>
            <p>Now for God to grant a meanes of defence, is a favour far more, to be ſo: and that when all humane Refuge is withdrawn. This <hi>David</hi> own'd with Thankfulneſs: <hi>All Refuge failed, none cared for my Soul,</hi> Pſal. 142.3, 4, 5, 6. The Cryes of naked Dependance on God, are moſt ſucceſsful. And again, the kindneſs of divine Defence and Salvation, moſt obliging to gratitude; the exigence of the Caſe did exagerate the Care and Kindneſs of God, He being now in the Cave (as ſays the Title) In another <hi>Pſalm,</hi> he admires the Bliſs of them that know the joyful Sound, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.15. <hi>(i.e.)</hi> of <hi>Aarons Bells,</hi> and <hi>Pomgra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates,</hi> heard in acceſs to the Altar-Service; and of the ſhout that attended, with the Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Trumpets ſound, in Token of God's Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance: that ſtill was a joyful Sound: and bleſſed to hear, (<hi>v.</hi> 17, 18.) for many reaſons, one is this: <hi>for the Lord is our Defence — and our King.</hi> It is then a bleſſed thing, to enjoy God over, and in our Meetings for Worſhip, to cover, ſhield, and defend them from all <hi>Distractions</hi> that <hi>Satan</hi> gives us within, or <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbance</hi> that happens without. One <hi>Pſalm</hi> more I urge, that is, his Appeal for Revenge
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:151110:169"/>againſt the Throne of Iniquity, that gathered themſelves to condemn the Guiltleſs, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 94.20. How came that Appeal off? Why, <hi>v.</hi> 22. tells us: <hi>But God is my Defence: — and the Rock of my Refuge.</hi> Nothing, that in perils, God is the only laſt <hi>Refuge:</hi> and the laſt <hi>verſe</hi> is an Inſtance of God's laſt <hi>Revenge</hi> on his Enemies, in cutting them off in their Iniquity, <hi>v.</hi> 23. If God receive our appeal, and be our Defence, wo to them that give him and his the Offence.</p>
            <p>Now, that our boaſt herein may be great, think thus with your ſelves; How many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are retired in Solitude? Nay, ſome Preachers, that have Bands laid on them (as <hi>Ezekiel</hi> had a long time in <hi>Babilon;</hi>) and that both by Men's Priſons, and alſo by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence; God puniſhing oft the Peoples Sin, in the Preachers ſilence: That of their Sin, is in one Chapter, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 3.24, 25, 26. The other is cited, <hi>ch.</hi> 4.8. God lays this on him, as a Type of Chriſt, and a ſign to both the Houſes of <hi>Iſrael</hi>'s and <hi>Judah</hi>'s long <hi>Exile;</hi> (<hi>Many Days, ſays</hi> Hoſea, <hi>without Priest,</hi> &amp;c. Hoſ. 3.5.) Hence it follows, <hi>They ſhall ſeek a Viſion of the Prophet, but the Law ſhall periſh from the Prieſt, Counſel from the Antients,</hi> Ezek. 7.26. And next, the King mourns, and the Prince is clad with Deſolation: the one ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenc't, the other muſt ſorrow.</p>
            <pb n="311" facs="tcp:151110:169"/>
            <p>But yet twice (at leaſt, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 11. <hi>ult.</hi>) af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, a Promiſe is given him, of an open mouth, a revival of Propheſie, <hi>ch.</hi> 24.27. at the bud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of <hi>Iſrael</hi>'s Horn, <hi>ch.</hi> 29.21. Some ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve a difference in the two Temples, as to Propheſy: the <hi>1ſt.</hi> had it 430 years; the <hi>2d.</hi> had it but 40 years: and (after <hi>Malachi</hi>) was only <hi>(Bath-col)</hi> the Daughter of a Voice. Here I cite a Paſſage of a late grave good Man on this. <hi>The</hi> Jews <hi>had five</hi> Megillaths,<note place="margin">

            <p>And what a fellow feeling ought we to have for the diſperſed Supplyants, that know not where to bring their Offerings, are drove from convenient places by force, and find no Houſes peceptive, without hazard; and Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren moroſe, timerous, ſupercilious, and ſo ſhy of their Places, and Seats, that ſome are glad to ſit down ſilent, and uſeleſs, to avoid giving any let, or trouble to others: and ſo, many hundreds are ſcattered, for want of room to worſhip God in.

            <p>Howbeit, ought not we, that have more protracted Peace, Chriſtian Liberty, quieter Vicinity, ſtiller Sabbaths, to return, the Fruits of God's Vineyard, let out to us, by a far lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger tenure, than to others.</p>
            <p>It will be ſoon known, if men proſper a while, whether any ſhall eſcape, or we ſhall all ſtand or fall at once.

So may you be juſtly <hi>ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> of unkindneſs to Chriſt, if as <hi>Pilate,</hi> you ſcourge him to let him go: the leaſt injury to ſweet Chriſt, and Truth, is <hi>Ingratitude</hi> to Chriſt; and ſay that of any, you ſay all: the Pins of God's Tabernacle are to be kept; the leaſt thread of Chriſt's ſeamleſs Coat; or the

            <p>If then your Lot be to be called out to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for Chriſt, conſult Duty and Honour; not what Evaſions or Subterfuges may be allowed, and ſpeak valliantly for your Maſter and his Cauſe: but if you are called to a part of his Croſs, put ſhoulder to it bravely, and count it your honour to be diſhonoured for his ſake, <hi>Asts</hi> 5.41.

            <p>Laſtly, it is matter of Conſolation: If God will defend us, let us take the Cup of Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 116.13.) and conclude all, (as the <hi>Jews</hi> did the Sabbath) with a Cordial Cup, that none might faint: from a two fold Fountain; either the <hi>Subjects</hi> to whom it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs; or the matter whence it flows.</p>
            <p>For the Perſons concerned, it is Zion and all her militant <hi>Seed:</hi> her Warfare is not yet accompliſht; 'tis yet to be fought in <hi>two</hi> or <hi>three</hi> Battles; the Controverſy is ſtill <hi>ſub Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice;</hi> an appointed Time is ſet with God, for its full period; and the <hi>Victory</hi> will ſurely fall to the Lamb and <hi>Zions</hi> Followers, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.14.

(<hi>vide.</hi> Dr. <hi>Mayer.</hi>) Which I note, to ſhew, that he ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived to ſee that Prince and City deſtroyed, that beſieged <hi>Zion,</hi> the City of God: and ſo it became a quiet Habitation, as was promis't, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 33.20. And <hi>Nahum's</hi> Propheſie (in <hi>ch.</hi> 1. <hi>ult.</hi>) was about 4 or 5 years after verified, in their ſolemn Feaſts; after this Son of <hi>Beli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al</hi> was cut off.</p>
            <p>Now this is the Buckler, and theſe are the Bullwarks that did, do, and will defend all the Sons of <hi>Zion</hi> that run to them. Having ſpoke to God's Attributes before, I add no more to this. A word to Promiſes.</p>
            <p>Now <hi>2dly.</hi> for Promiſes, they are Springs, that empty themſelves by golden Pipes in our dry <hi>Cisterns,</hi> dayly, to quench our Thirſt, and cool our Heat in Perſecution: and theſe allay our Fears, before Troubles come; which oft are worſe than the Troubles: and this do they in two Rivolets: the one is the nature; the ſecond is their various matter: a little to both; eſpecially, the firſt (the latter leſs, being toucht before) that I may avoid all
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:151110:176"/>prolixity, and not <hi>bis cocta apponere.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. The nature, and proper adjuncts of Gods Promiſes are food, and fence to the pious. Two Ingredients make them very cordial; the Properties of God are the In-works of our Fort. The Promiſes, (as one ſays) <hi>are the Out-works;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jer. Dyke, Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous — Man's Tower. <hi>P. 34.</hi>
               </note> if we get into them that is our Safety; and the Tower is the Safety of the <hi>Out-works,</hi> and all that flee to them. Theſe are the Clefts of the Rock. So he.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Oh my Dove, thou art in the Clefts of the Rock, let me ſee, and hear thee there,</hi> (ſays Chriſt to his Spouſe, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2.14, 15.) And now take the <hi>Foxes,</hi> to note our Safety in the Clefts of Promiſes from all <hi>Foxes,</hi> and wild Beaſts of Prey, that ſhould no more hinder them (as <hi>Mayer</hi> obſerves) in Duties of Piety and holy Feaſts. God's <hi>Doves</hi> being (as <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys</hi>) feeble and fearful; the <hi>Hawks</hi> purſue the one, and ferrets the other; are glad to neſt and burrow in the Rock. Now it is not the lot of the <hi>Spouſe,</hi> ever to be viſible: ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in Deſerts and Dens; as one ſays, <hi>(Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay) Non tect is, &amp; exteriori pompâ;</hi> but in plain <hi>Ruſſet,</hi> as when her Lord firſt eſpouſed her. Now the good of a Promiſe lyes in two things. <hi>1st.</hi> It is ſuitale to our Caſe. <hi>2dly.</hi> Sure and durable; and in both, great, (like the Author) and pretious in their uſe to us.</p>
            <p>For the firſt, no Caſe can befall, but ſome
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:151110:177"/>Promiſe, or ſomewhat in the Promiſe obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates it. <hi>Doth Zion mourn; He will reſtore again Comfort both to Her and her Mourners,</hi> Iſai 57.18. <hi>Are her Aſſemblies ſcattered? A Promiſe is of gathering,</hi> Zeph. 3.18. <hi>Are Teachers in Corners? They Eyes ſhall ſee thy Teachers,</hi> &amp;c. Iſai, 30.20. <hi>Are they exiled to the Ends of the Earth? Yet he will hiſs for them, and they ſhall come,</hi> Zech. 10.1. <hi>And bring their Offering,</hi> Zeph. 3.10. As one (abroad) at Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s death, ſaid in a Sermon; and ſoon after, the News of her death came, and they were recalled home. Promiſes are adap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to all the ſad Caſes of <hi>Zion</hi>'s Sons.</p>
            <p n="2">2. They are ſure, firm, and perpetual; Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes fail not, far leſs for evermore, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.20. A delay, or ſuſpenſe may be, for the Sin of declining; that may look as a Breach of Promiſe, or turn to a Threat, <hi>Numb,</hi> 14.34. But 'tis fulfilled (with uſe) to the next Age. As Juſtice ſtands bound for the Threat, and Goodneſs for the Promiſes: So is Gods Truth and Veracity for both. Oh <hi>Zion,</hi> beloved of God, fear not, look up; thy King lives, that was dead; and he dyed not <hi>Inteſtate:</hi> but now he lives to make good that <hi>Legacy</hi> of Peace here, to his Followers, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.27. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the Inheritance at laſt: Who will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove his Fidelity to his <hi>Word</hi> (<hi>Promiſe</hi> and <hi>Oath</hi>) and alſo to his <hi>Spouſe.</hi> So that I ſay to <hi>Zion,</hi> as a faithful Witneſs once ſaid

               </note> 
               <hi>— wherewith ſhall I comfort thee? A Father of the Fatherleſs, a Judge of the Wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, is God in his holy Habitation: as God is God, thou ſhalt never want, nor thine; but in all the ſad days a coming, you ſhall be Wonders of Mercy, in all Places; and not a hair of your head fall to the Earth.</hi> And the Reporter ſurvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to ſee it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2dly</hi> The matter of the Promiſes, as 'tis various, ſo divers have wrote well on it; and ſomewhat being done before, leſs may now ſuffice, ſave only to touch this point of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; or what material Promiſes are, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to it, (or the defence of it) or what Propheſies do incourage to hope for better things.</p>
            <p>Truly, there is nothing we are bid, or bound to pray for, but ſome propheſy backs, and bottoms our hope in it.</p>
            <p>As, 1. a Promiſe is made of a divine Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 34, 13. in the worſt Times of the greateſt diſperſion; and to that is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned alſo a Propheſy of its Continuation, <hi>ch.</hi> 43.7.8. Nor is any thing of greater Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port to the being and beauty of Worſhip, and Church-ſtate, Power of the Keys, Miniſtry, (in both the breeding &amp; feeding of Converts)
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:151110:178"/>and to all holy Matters; then a <hi>Shechina</hi> (as the <hi>Jews</hi> calls it) or a Divine Majeſty or Glory attending. If this be, its ſelf alone keeps up a ſure defence over us, puts a glory upon all; lays a terrour on the Aſſailants, or claps a Talent of Lead, a fulminating bolt of Judgment on the head of that hairy Goat, that dares God in his own ground; and here lyes our defence. If this be a wanting, (far more) if it by our Provocation (after long ſtay) do make a receſs; all our Miſeries and Woes enter at the door where it goes out: be it a Perſon or a People, a Prince (as <hi>Saul,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 28.15.) or a Prieſt, a Prophet: let God depart; and eſpecially, if we ſay, <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part,</hi> Job. 21.14. Cauſe the Holy One to ceaſe from before us, we deſire not the knowledge of thy ways, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 30.11. As it is hard to retain him going, ſo it is harder to reclaim him, if gone. Now ſome Paſſages do (as to this) allay and preponderate the dolour of our Caſe. One is that holy boaſt of the Prophet (<hi>Ezek.</hi> 35.5, 10.) againſt <hi>Edom,</hi> for their bloodineſs to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> in the time of their Calamity, hoping to lay claim to, and poſſeſs the two Countries: and what ſhould let them? why only this, — <hi>Whereas the Lord was there.</hi> It notes ſweetly, that the divine Preſence is a Defence ſtrong enough to prevent, (nay) to expell an Enemy at the higheſt of hopes.</p>

               <note n="*" place="margin">In Locum, <hi>p. 488.</hi>
               </note> That the Goſpel Temple ſhall be more glorious than ever that of <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>'s was: becauſe into that of <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> came Chriſt in Perſon, (though <hi>Herod</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged it) Chriſt's Preſence was the true Glory of it, he being a Greater than <hi>Solomon.</hi> And I believe, as <hi>Haggai</hi>'s Propheſy was once verified in the Letter, (<hi>Hag.</hi> 2.9.) So it will be again, in the Spirit, fulfilled of the <hi>2d. Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel</hi> Temple (or <hi>Church State</hi>) at the open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, when the ſeven laſt <hi>Vials</hi> of Wrath, are repleat on <hi>Romiſh Antichrist;</hi> and that
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:151110:179"/>belief is confirmed by that Propheſy of the next Temple opened, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. <hi>ult.</hi> ch. 16.5.8. (i.e.) after the glorious reſurrection of the Witneſſes, and the effuſion of the <hi>Phialls:</hi> from which on the whole, (<hi>Ezek</hi> and <hi>John</hi> collated) I may note a little, and cite an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor or two, and ſo leave it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Temple-Church-State, till the two Wi neſſes ariſe, and the latter <hi>Phyals</hi> obtain on <hi>Rome,</hi> ſeems to be a ſhut up ſtate; allud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that of wicked <hi>Ahaz.</hi> that ſhut up Doors, that ſo God mihgt not keep open Houſe, among them, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28.24. And who dwells in a ſhut Houſe? Whieh though it is ſad to ſee, yet is but the ſame affliction others have had: that is ſome allay.</p>
            <p>Now what, how far, and how long this may be? why? and what are the Signs of it? and of the next opening, I here do not aſſay: but if our Covert for the Sabbath be removed, we do but ſhare as others. Next I note. There is a glorious time of opening comes, together with the Fall of Antichriſt an opening many ways, of Eyes and Ears, of Hearts and Hands, of Prophets Mouths and Church Doors (ſo as none can ſhut them) and Priſoners door too. When the horn of <hi>David</hi> buds (<hi>Ezek.</hi> 29.20.) once for all: and then (as <hi>Cotton</hi> ſays) will be the glorious Church-State, after the <hi>Whore</hi> is judged. But the great opening is of <hi>Temple-Worſhip.</hi> Now as the <hi>Ark</hi> was the <hi>Symbole</hi> of God's Worſhip, ſo it typed Chriſt: and thus
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:151110:179"/>it was a ſign of the gracious preſence of Chriſt with the latter reformed, or renewed <hi>Church-State;</hi> and till this is, we do but meaſure out a Platform, or hew out for a Temple, or fix Scaffolds rather than build.</p>
            <p>Now that a Preſence with us, is ſuch ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to us, I cite a paſſage at the Siege of <hi>Belgrade,</hi> (by <hi>Mahomet</hi>) one <hi>Capistranus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Piſga. Evang. <hi>P. 225.</hi>
               </note> a Mino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite, ſo incouraged the <hi>Christians,</hi> not with Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitions, but theſe Crys — <q rend="inline">
                  <hi>Jeſus</hi> look on us, be preſent with thine, that ſuffer for thee: Where are thy Mercies of old? Come and defend thy People, leaſt they ſay among the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> Where now is their God?</q> And ſo the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> won a noble and rich Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. By Chriſt's Preſence we overcome. If that be loſt, the Enemies triumph.</p>
            <p>Now for Notes of Authors, I only cite two. 1. A paſſage of <hi>Mede:</hi> [<hi>Joſ. Mede</hi> in <hi>Apoc. part</hi> 2. p. 106.] <q rend="inline">All comes out of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: <hi>Harveſt</hi> and <hi>Vintage,</hi> obtain by the Prayers of both Saints and holy Martyrs: for that Cry comes from the Altar; and the blood of the Martyrs too, crys for Vengence. Thus the Prayers of <hi>Daniel</hi> and the poor Widdow got,</q> (that Releaſe, this Revenge) And ſo he concludes. <q rend="inline">Hear, O Chriſt, the King, call to mind, the humble Supplications of thy Servants, for thy Kingdom; and ſo many groans of the afflicted and ſlain, for thy
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:151110:180"/>Name ſake: And when the time that ſeems to thee moſt fit, comes, ariſe to reap the <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt,</hi> and gather the Grapes.</q> And no ſmall Comfort it is, to find that the Kingdom of Chriſt, the Fall of Antichriſt, and return of Prayers, come all ſtreaming at once, in a full tyde of Mercy to the devout; and Wrath up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all Atheiſts and Antichriſtians: and the Times, with their Wrath, haſtens it.</p>
            <p>One Author more, I cite [<hi>T. P.</hi> his ſober Gueſs, pag. 187.] at the end of that lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Book, where he hints the ruine of that Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous Age, that waſted the Church afore, and the appearance of our Ark, that is of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus;</hi> and ſo he ends with three Notes. 1. That Sorrows ſteal not on us, without the foreſight, counſel, and Predetermination of God. 2. That the end and meaſure of them is ſet of God: though Force and Violence may lett true Religion, 'tis but for a Time; <hi>Antiochus,</hi> Swines Fleſh, the two Witneſſes lying dead, Our Lords abode (as <hi>Jonah</hi>'s and the Church's) two or three days in the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulcre, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 6.2. are all limited to about the ſame length, as <hi>Elijah</hi>'s three Years and ſix months; and then our dead revive again. <hi>pag.</hi> 188.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <q rend="inline">In all Oppreſſions of the Saints, they never are void of his Preſence; and a promiſe of a Deliverance, with Faith in its accompliſhment, and hope that the time is nigh expiration. <bibl>

            <pb n="333" facs="tcp:151110:180"/>
            <p>So he concludes with one <hi>Drs.</hi> Saying <hi>(Viz.)</hi> (<hi>Dr. More</hi>'s Myſtery of <hi>Godlineſs,</hi> lib. 5. c. 17. of the uſe of <hi>Apolyptical Viſions.</hi> Who affirms (<hi>A.

               <q rend="inline">Nor is Stability in Kingdoms to be had, till the new City is raiſed, whoſe Walls, Foundation, Gates, and whole Content, is but the Replication of twelve <hi>(i.e.)</hi> all Apoſtolick, in Doctrine, Worſhip, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q> Which hope ſhould ſhake off that <hi>Lethargy</hi> on us: as if it would never be better; and it comes not by Rapine and Violence, but by Increaſe of Righteouſneſs.</p>
            <p>And though the time is deferred, and many Concuſſions precede the Concluſion, yet are we to wait for it; nay, to ſolace our Souls in the frightful ſigns Preceding it: as our Lord bids us, to look up in the hope of this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, approaching; for the Lords roar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of <hi>Zion,</hi> (Joel 3.16.) is but as a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face to the Hope and Strength that he gives to his; and his ſhaking of all things (<hi>Hag.</hi> 2.7.) is but to eſtabliſh that Kingdom that
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:151110:181"/>ſhall remain, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.28. Never was a glorious reviving of hopes, without a grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Sentence of death, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37.10. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.2. The very wild <hi>Iriſh</hi> may teach us, that on the moſt ſtormy day, we may lift up our heads (as they on the Hills) and joy in hope, the next is fair Weather by turn.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Polanus</hi> obſerves, that <hi>Seſoſtris,</hi> King of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> obſerving one of his Kings,<note place="margin">On <hi>Ezek.</hi> 1.</note> drawing of his Chariot, ey'd the Wheel, ask't the cauſe: he anſwered, that he ſaw that part that earſt was up, now was low, <hi>(&amp; vice versâ)</hi> on which he made the <hi>Moral,</hi> and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed it; ſo looſed them from that Slavery: For Promotion comes not from <hi>Eaſt</hi> or <hi>Weſt,</hi> but God pulls down one, and exalts another, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 75.6. Or, (as in <hi>Job</hi>) ſetteth on high them that be low, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.11. Or (as <hi>Mary</hi> ſung) exalts them of low degree, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.52.

            <p>For in the days of theſe Kings, 'tis by <hi>Dan.</hi> 2.44. predicted, the God of Heaven ſhall ſet up a Kingdom that ſhall not be ſhaken, or given to others. And if any ask, How? that Text, <hi>v.</hi> 34.45. (and it was the Dream of a King) ſhows you <hi>(Eben
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:151110:181"/>di al Bijdian: aſciſſus lapis, qui in manibus non eſt (ſine manibus)</hi> Which notes not only, that 'tis out of the reach of humane hands, to prevent that Kingdom, the time being come for its commencement: but above the help of ſecular means (or hands) to advance it. I conclude this (as one does a Book) with warning to Princes to ſubmit to the Redeemer, and prevent the ſhower of Vengeance impend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: for ſix Changes are paſt in the World already, and (ſays he) a ſeventh will be Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batical, giving reſt from all your Pride and Ambition. And this takes the laſt place and turn, but proves of the greateſt extent. And I add, as the Courſe and Conjunctions of the caeleſtial Bodies, and alſo of terreſtial, do all configure, and concenter in this kingdom; ſo the Councels of men, and Conteſts about pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Affairs, concur, and contribute to it; and all contrary <hi>Wheels,</hi> that ſeem to have a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter motion in the way, ſhal at laſt center in the ſame bleſſed Ends, <hi>(Viz.)</hi> The ſound of the laſt Trump; an Alarm to <hi>Babel-Romes</hi> Fall, (whoſe Waters are now a drying up) the pouring out of the laſt Vial, that leaves not Air for her Tyranny to breath in. And as that late Dr. ſays, (Dr. <hi>T. G. in</hi> Apoc. <hi>pag.</hi> 190.) <q rend="inline">The nearer this Kingdom is, (as a Gulf) to ſwallow all Time, the greater Changes will Chriſt make;</q> and to ſee no Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations to it, may not diſcourage our Faith,
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:151110:182"/>ſince of things extraordinary, there needs none, being the Efforts of divine hands.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>3dly.</hi> And laſt of all, there ſprings up a Well of Support to devout and conſtant Souls, from the Providence of God: that like the eye, ſcouts out to and fro; and prevides Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rils, provides Preſervatives, and ſtands armed on Sentinel, to ſecure the main Guard, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcue his Men and Matters aſſaulted.</p>
            <p>Now this is the Wheel full of Eyes, that Chriſt's Chariot of Love runs upon; and is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſwift, ſeldom ſtands, never runs idly, by Rote, or blind Chance, and Caſualty; far leſs, retrogade, or to overturn them that are in it; for Chriſt doth guide it.</p>
            <p>Sirs, could we take right Meaſures of Gods Providences, in former, or latter days; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of a Quarrel, we ſhould take up that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miring word, (<hi>Ezek.</hi> 10.13.) and ſay, <hi>Oh Wheel!</hi> But 'tis hard to ſee both ſides of things at once: for often Providences have a dark ſide (at firſt view) preſenting to our terrour: and after, a bright ſide is ſeen; as that Cloud betwixt <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Aegypt,</hi> had of old: but the Lord turned the dark ſide to the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Hoſt, and the bright to <hi>Iſrael</hi> by Night, <hi>Exod.</hi> 14.20, 24, 25.

That way diſtreſs, (by <hi>Chaldeans</hi>) was moſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere; here in the <hi>North,</hi> God's Spirit cryes; and two of them; firſt the black (after) the white, go there, to quiet the Groans of his People.

            <p>Note here only two Points.</p>
            <p n="1">1.

            <p n="2">2. Various Efforts of <hi>providential Wrath,</hi> ſent out on the Churches Enemies, tend to the quieting of God's Spirit (crying and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding in his Suffering People) and this is not to reſt, till the white Horſes poſt after the black; to bring Joy, Peace, and Reſt to the oppreſt in the <hi>North:</hi> which will ſoon follow the former Diſtreſſes.</p>
            <pb n="344" facs="tcp:151110:186"/>
            <p>One obſerves (on <hi>Hoſea</hi>) of that King that on a morning was cut off, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 10. <hi>ult.</hi> It was <hi>Hoſhea;</hi> and that in him the whole Line and Reign of the ten Tribes ſurccaſt, and were extinct, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 17.4. For he being falſe to his word, the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> depoſes, and impriſons him: ſubverts <hi>Samaria</hi> and his Kingdom; and Captives the ten Tribes. And why all this? For the Sin of <hi>Bethel:</hi> what they thought would confirm and ſettle, did ſubvert the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anaxagoras,</hi> for writing a Book of the <hi>Moon</hi>'s Ecclipſes, (after they in <hi>Athens</hi> had received her for a God) was impriſoned; and but for <hi>Pericles,</hi> had died. Had they ſo fooliſh a Jealouſie for a fictitious mutable God: and ſhall not the true God (that changes not) be as Jealous for his Glory, Truth, Ways and Worſhip? Surely, with <hi>Nahum,</hi> I may ſay, <hi>Oh</hi> Judah! <hi>keep thy Solemn Feaſts — for the — Belial is utterly cut off,</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hum 1.15.</p>
            <p n="3">3. As <hi>Providence</hi> is active in puniſhing ſome, ſo is alſo in preſerving others; that is the darker, this is the brighter ſide of it; there God's Horſes are black, here all white: Such as Jeſus rode on, in conquering the firſt Emperial Dragon, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 6.2. &amp; 19.11. And keeps ſtill, for the laſt <hi>Papal</hi> Victory: That <hi>Victoria Halelujatica:</hi> when all the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies in Heaven, are ſo mounted: not on
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:151110:186"/>white Horſes (in the Letter) but on a Series of glorious Succeſſes, purely on the Lambs and his Followers account; and alſo on Seats of Rule and Dignity: of which, that Colour was a Sign, or Badge of old. <hi>Judg.</hi> 5.10. Now in nothing more doth Providence weave the curious Webbs of Salvation, than in this. So was <hi>Lot</hi> pulled out of <hi>Sodom, Jacob</hi> preſerved from <hi>Eſau,</hi> and <hi>Laban</hi> alſo; <hi>Joſeph</hi> ſaved from his Brethren, and by their Envy ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc't over them all: ſo all the Family was fed in <hi>Aegypt:</hi> (ſo <hi>Moſes</hi> is hid, drawn out, Nurſed by his own Mother, <hi>Exod.</hi> 2.7, 8.) adopted, educated, advanc't in the Court: nay, at laſt (as a God) over it; as (when but an Infant) was predicted of him; (<hi>Burr. on Heb.</hi> 11, 25.) Thus is <hi>Iſrael</hi> brought out with an High Hand, and Wonders wrought at Sea and Land for it.</p>
            <p>Thus <hi>David</hi> in the Cave; <hi>Jeremiah</hi> and <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruch</hi> alſo were hid: So <hi>Eſther</hi> wheels the King about, and turns the Plot on <hi>Haman.</hi> So the three Children in the Furnace, and <hi>Daniel</hi> in the Den of Lions, are reſcued, <hi>Dan.</hi> 6.23. So Jeſus with <hi>Joſeph</hi> and <hi>Mary,</hi> are ſent to <hi>Aegypt</hi> for Safety; and (about two years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) call'd back, and the Infants blood aveng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on <hi>Herod;</hi> but Jeſus is ſaved, <hi>Mat.</hi> 2.</p>
            <p>For further Inſtances of Gods wondrous and ſecret Providence, in ſaving his at their Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:151110:187"/>many are worthy of Recognition.

            <p>The providential Preſervations of God's Courtiers, is a Theam worthy of the wit, read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and Pen of Angels; not only to obſerve the <hi>Shield of Defence,</hi> held cut for the <hi>Safety</hi> of the <hi>Pious,</hi> (perſonally) in all Times of danger: but in a more ſpecial way, over the whole Body of the <hi>Elect,</hi> in the moſt perillous Times that have, or can come.</p>

            <p>But ſince this comfortable Subject multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies in the breaking, I will ſhut it up with a Scripture, and an Inſtance or two.</p>
            <pb n="351" facs="tcp:151110:189"/>
            <p>The Scripture is that of the Women, help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the earth againſt all the Floods of Slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, Hereſy, Idolatry, and Perſecution, caſt out by the Dragon againſt her, and her Seed: with cruel Edicts, Laws, Decrees, Cannons, and Eccleſiaſtical Curſes, and Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Now comes in the help of the Earth, <hi>VIZ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. By pleading the Womans Cauſe againſt all the ſalſe Calumnies of the Enemies, caſt on their Aſſemblies, as <hi>Plinius.</hi> 2. <hi>Reinerus,</hi> (the <hi>Inquiſitor</hi>) &amp;c. that helpt her.</p>
            <p n="2">2. By caſting a Bone among the Enemy, as <hi>Paul,</hi> 'twixt the <hi>Phariſees</hi> and <hi>Sadduces</hi> about the Reſurection.</p>
            <p>A. D. 1526. (Dr. <hi>Taylor,</hi> Apoc. 12.16. <hi>Warr with the Dragon,</hi> p. 810.) <hi>Carl.</hi> 5. and <hi>Franc.</hi> 1. joyn Forces, to root out <hi>Luthariſme,</hi> and yet the <hi>Pope</hi> (intending other ends) breaks that League, gives the Emperour in <hi>Italy</hi> ſuch Work, as diverts him from the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants,</hi> that elſe had periſht.</p>
            <p>So <hi>Anno</hi> 1530. <hi>Charl.</hi> 5. paſt a cruel Edict againſt the Profeſſors of the Goſpel, that fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed would ſwallow them all up, (at the Dyet of <hi>Auſperge</hi>) but lo the Earth helpt the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man: for now the <hi>Turk</hi> (as if he had been carryed by the hair of his head) invades the Empire, and <hi>Auſtria:</hi> ſo now inſtead of Peace (to eaſe them of that Edict) hee's glad of their Aid againſt the <hi>Turk;</hi> a thing
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:151110:190"/>acting again, now by the <hi>Turk:</hi> but in what Fitneſs the <hi>Emperours</hi> 50000, is, I ſee not, to give battle to thrice that number: Now the <hi>Turk</hi> has got occaſion by the Forelock, and the <hi>Hungarian Proteſtants</hi> ſo diſoblieged, that a <hi>Barbarian</hi> Infidel gives better truce, and terms to <hi>Christians,</hi> then they allow one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. So rampant is the Spirit of Perſecution, now in <hi>Europe:</hi> but I note it for Support, to ſhow that ſome ſad Sights, may bode to good Signs: and Evils <hi>(per ſe)</hi> may prove good by accident, for the Godly in the iſſue.</p>
            <p>It ſeems an Alluſion to the Ark of <hi>Noah,</hi> God for a years time, (and ſome odd days) was <hi>Pilot</hi> himſelf by his Providence, till at laſt it reſted on the Mount <hi>Ararat;</hi> and the Earth by little and little, drunk up that Flood; ſo God doth by Earthly Men, Means, and Aims, help his Holy Ark; till (at laſt) ſome Dove returns with an <hi>Olive Leaf</hi> of Peace, with good Tydings. For Chriſt our Head being far above all the Floods, hence it is, his Body cannot be drown'd; the Waters that drown'd God's Enemies, yet ſav'd his <hi>Iſrael. Dani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el</hi>'s <hi>Lion,</hi> and <hi>Jonah</hi>'s <hi>Whale,</hi> were Types of this: That by which we look for Ruine, is God's means to ſet us on dry Ground. So the Troubles in <hi>Spain</hi> find the Emperour of <hi>Germany</hi> work, in 1521, when his Fury is ſo raiſed againſt <hi>Luther;</hi> at laſt the States met
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:151110:190"/>at <hi>Norinberge</hi> (as here <hi>Samuel</hi> at <hi>Mizpeh</hi>) and ſo mitigate that Edict, and helpt the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Waldo</hi>'s Exile and his Followers, was of uſe to the ſpreading of the Goſpel ore <hi>Europe,</hi> in the darkeſt Times of <hi>Popery:</hi> for the Earth brings it up again as good Seed.

            <p>There were on the firſt Captivity, ſome Brethren, by Nation (like ours) inſulting over them in <hi>Ezekiel</hi>'s Time, (<hi>Ezek.</hi> 21.15. who went into <hi>Babylon,</hi> and challenged all the Land and Temple to themſelves, inſtead of looking to ſhare alike with them after (as they did, <hi>v.</hi> 16.)

Now how they perform, is too large here to treat: it ſuffices, if I glean an Inſtance, or two; not ſo much of the evil Angels, that are oft over ruled, as Inſtruments of Wrath. So a voice ſaid to <hi>Bruno,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Herbipolis: Ho, Ho! thou Biſhop, I am thy Malus Genius, thou art
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:151110:192"/>mine, go where thou wilt; though I am not now to hurt thee, I ſhall ſoon ſee thee again.</hi> (Dr <hi>Beard,</hi> p. 432.) And ſo it fell out ſoon after, he being in a Room (with others) that part of the Room fell, over him; he dies, and the reſt eſcap't unhurt. But the Service of the Good, and for the Good, is that I aim at.</p>
            <p>That Author (Dr. <hi>Beard</hi>) after ſome ſeventeen Examples of Scripture, cites twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty two Stories of later days, of which I recite two or three.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Out of <hi>Socrates;</hi> (p. 439. <hi>Sozomen, lib.</hi> 8. <hi>c.</hi> 4.) Of <hi>Gainas</hi> an <hi>Arrian;</hi> by <hi>Arcadius</hi> ſent to <hi>Conſtantinople;</hi> who in Enmity to <hi>Chryſostome,</hi> came on that City, in the night, to ſpoil it; and two Nights, was well reſiſted by an Army of tall, and luſty men; the <hi>Tyrant</hi> being apt to believe it was a Fable, came the third time in perſon, found it true, and with the terrour, fled to <hi>Thracia,</hi> and ſo was there miſerably ſlain. I gather hence, their way muſt be dark and ſlippery, if the Angel of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovah</hi> chaſe them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 35.5, 6.</p>
            <p>A ſecond, is of <hi>Antioch,</hi> (Anno 585. <hi>Out of one</hi> Sigbertus, <hi>in the time of</hi> Mauritius.) where was a pious and hoſpitable man, that would not Dine or Supp without ſome poor Man, and coming into the <hi>Market-Place,</hi> meets a grave old Man, all in white, (and two with him) whom he intreats to Supp with him: but the Old Man anſwers, he had
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:151110:193"/>more need to pray againſt the <hi>Deſtruction</hi> of the City: ſo inſtantly ſhook his <hi>Handkerchief</hi> towards two parts of the City; but for the third part, was intreated to forbear, and ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily thoſe two parts fell by a <hi>Earth-quake,</hi> in which thouſands were ſlain, the hoſpitable Man ſpared; and ſo the three Angels vaniſht: Angels have Commiſſion both to ſhake Cities, and to ſecure the <hi>Pious</hi> therein. Lord, grant <hi>London</hi> be not nigh ſuch a ſhake.</p>
            <p>A third, is one <hi>Tiburtius,</hi> (From <hi>Marullus Spalatenſ.</hi>) a Heathen, Ruler of <hi>Areciam,</hi> prohibits <hi>Pergentinus,</hi> and <hi>Laurentinus,</hi> to preach Chriſt; and not obtaining by Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries, he cauſed them to be beat by Clubs; but the Arms of thoſe that beat them, ſo wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered, they could not ſtrike: after, he would fain have ſtarved them in Priſon; but an Angel fed them there: after, he cauſed them to go on burning Coals; but no ſenſe of hurt: next, <hi>Jupiters</hi> Image is brought, to Worſhip; which reſolv'd to duſt, they calling on the Name of Jeſus; and mark the iſſue: for hence many of the <hi>Heathens</hi> forſook their Idols, for the Faith of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Which teaches, that Chriſt preſerves faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Witneſſes, by making Idols vaniſh, and fall before his Name, and gains ground for Truth, by the very fury of <hi>Idolaters:</hi> and what will it bring, when all Idols are aboliſht utterly, and famiſh't, and the Lord alone ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted? <hi>Iſai.</hi> 2.18. <hi>Zeph.</hi> 2.11.</p>
            <pb n="353" facs="tcp:151110:193"/>
            <p>A fourth, out of the Lives of the Fathers. In <hi>Julian,</hi> the <hi>Apostate</hi>'s days, a <hi>Christian</hi> caſt in Priſon, (by his Souldiers) being viſited by <hi>Apolonus,</hi> they detained both: ſetting a Watch, leaſt they eſcap't: but that Night, an Angel (moſt clear) came, opened the Door, frighted the Watch and the Centurion, ſlew ſome of his Servants,; the Keeper came in, trembling, and delivered the two <hi>Chriſtians</hi> free: as <hi>Peter</hi> was, <hi>Acts</hi> 12. and <hi>Acts</hi> 16.</p>
            <p>But this being more than ſufficient to our end, I draw to a Concluſion, and in the laſt place, will only obſerve with Mr. <hi>Fox,</hi> (<hi>Acts</hi> and <hi>Monuments,</hi> Anno 1558. pag. 2031.) the more than ordinary Preſervations, that God gave that one Faithfull, ſeparated Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, in Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s days (towards her end) in <hi>London.</hi> Of which he writes this ſtrange Providential Viſion, (in a Dream) that Mr. <hi>Rough</hi> had (a little ere he was taken) of <hi>Cuthbert Simſon;</hi> (and that twice) that he ſaw the Guard lead him Priſoner, and the Book of all the Names, and Accounts of the Congregation in his Pocket: and as he is making ready to go to him; (as God would have it) in comes <hi>Cuthbert Simſon,</hi> to whom he told his Dream; willing him to lay the Book away, and not to carry it about; which he being unwilling to do, taking Dreams for Phantaſies; Mr. <hi>Rough</hi> charged him in the Lord's Name to do it: ſo he left it with Mr. <hi>Rough:</hi> which had it been took with him (as

            <p>A little after, (<hi>pag.</hi> 2074.) the Author obſerves, of this ſaithful Congregation, that it was continued all the Reign of Queen <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> (that was five years) mauger the Malice and Inquiſition of Men, and ſtrictneſs of Laws to the contrary; and all by the uſual good Hand of God on them. Of which many In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances are notified.</p>
            <p n="1">1. At the Houſe of Sir <hi>Thomas Cardens,</hi> the Miſchief laid for them, was Prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>

            </p>
            <p>A third Eſcape was (in an Alley) by the <hi>Conduit; Jo. Avails</hi> ſaw them, ſent for the <hi>Sheriffs;</hi> but ere they came, the People were gone.</p>
            <p>A fourth, was in a Ship at <hi>Billingſ gate,</hi> in the open view of all, they met, and yet eſcap't all.</p>
            <pb n="359" facs="tcp:151110:195"/>
            <p>A fifth, was on board of Ship called, the <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> betwixt <hi>Ratcliff</hi> and <hi>Redriff,</hi> and had Prayers, Sermon, and Sacrament, and yet eſcap't (though not unſeen) untaken.</p>

            <p>A ſeventh, narrow eſcape in <hi>Thames-ſtreet,</hi> was in the Night, the Houſe beſet; but a <hi>Mariner</hi> ſwims to a Boar, and with his Shoes (for <hi>Oars</hi>) ſculls them over water; ſo all are ſaved.</p>
            <p>Eigthly, once one comes in to take their Names, but is convinc't, and crys them mercy.</p>
            <p>A ninth, the eſcape was great, in the tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Mr. <hi>Rough</hi> and <hi>Cuth. Simſon,</hi> in that the Book of all their Names was not alſo taken. Nay, their Number increaſed at the end of <hi>Q.

            <p>Once <hi>Bentham</hi> (by two Men) was forced to be of a <hi>Crowners Inquest,</hi> and a <hi>Popiſh</hi> Prim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer being offered him, (to ſwear on) he opens it, and finds fault with the <hi>Contents,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Another Eſcape, was of the Godly in <hi>Calice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A twelfth, is (a little afore related, <hi>pag.</hi> 2074) of the Aſſembly at <hi>Stoke</hi> in <hi>Suffolk;</hi> that by good Union and Cloſeneſs, avoided their Rage, and yet refuſed to receive at the Prieſts hands: One <hi>Fox</hi> (with <hi>Cotes</hi> the Prieſt) now practice to put a Force on <hi>Fox</hi>'s Wife, to receive: who creeps to her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and tells them: ſo the good Women bid her be chearful, for they would pray for her, and him too; and good was the Iſſue: <hi>Fox</hi> comes to them quite another Man, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wailed his heady raſhneſs, prays Forgiveneſs, promiſing to be ſtronger in Faith thereafter, to their and his Wives great Joy. And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that, when the Biſhop of <hi>Norwich</hi>'s Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers came and ſent for them, they kept out abroad, and eſcap't.</p>
            <p>In all which, I note the truth of our point, the watchful Eye, and Care of Providence, ore his Work, Worſhip, and faithful Witneſſes in time of peril: tho the boldneſs of God's Servants, might likely have expoſed them to

            <p>For any may obſerve, that the number of the Faithful in Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s days (of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plored memory) ſay they amounted in five year, to about ſeven or eight hundred (in all) in Queen <hi>Elizabeth's</hi> came to as many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands, beſides thoſe before ſurviving; (and all the Exiles;) and could an accurate com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute be took, of their Increaſe in the two laſt Kings Times; and under the <hi>Odiums</hi> of <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritans, Roundheads, Schiſmaticks, Phanaticks,</hi> and <hi>Whiggs.</hi> (or <hi>Trimmers</hi>) it would eaſily be found, that for one <hi>Puritan</hi> of old, ten <hi>Phana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks</hi> are now; and it ſhows what thanks are due to <hi>Obſervator,</hi> that almoſt has ſubdivided all the Kings Leiges into two equal ſtreams (yea, the <hi>Church of England</hi> it ſelf, not eſcaping his <hi>Cleaver</hi>) Viz. the <hi>Tory</hi> and <hi>Whigg Party.</hi> And when ſuch cloven Feet and Pens, and all dividing Practices, are laid aſide; and uniting Principles obtain among us: the thing <hi>Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,</hi>
               <pb n="362" facs="tcp:151110:197"/>and the Name of a <hi>Protestant</hi> ſhall be better reputed of.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>Interim,</hi> ſince God is ſo cary of his Altar, and ſo juſt a Revenger of Appellants (that fly to its horns) for a Sanctuary; and yet are hauled thence by Violence: let us comfort our Souls in our continued Crys, with the Souls and Urns under it; for the Lord comes out of his place, (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 26. <hi>ult.</hi>) to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh Wrongs, and the Earth ſhall diſcloſe her Blood, and no more cover her Slain.</p>
            <p>Again, if no Hedge or Shelter, no ordinary means be left about us: God, in ſome ſuper-ordinary way, will be ſeen, as once in the Mount, to ſave <hi>Iſaac,</hi> (the Knife being at the Throat) by an Angel, (<hi>Gen.</hi> 22.) and the puſhing <hi>Ram</hi> ſhall be caught in his own Thic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets, to become the Victim, for the bleſt Seed, the Sons of the Promiſe.</p>
            <p>And as the ſhutting of the Temple calls for Sorrow, ſo with its opening, comes out ſeven Angels (as ſeven Thunders) one of which is that of the Altar, <hi>Rev.</hi> 16.5.7. Whoſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation is, about God's righteous Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which will make the Ears of abſurd, deaf Sinners tingle, and their heart tremble.</p>
            <p>If God would thunder on <hi>Philiſtims</hi> for his Ark, and Suckling, then, (which was but Typical Service) can we think (now his Enemies are more) that his Care, Power, and Love is leſs? Did it coſt ſuch ado, that
